2,72 Seasons ,"Verse 1]
Feeding on the wrath of man
Shot down, traumatic
Time haunted by the past
Long gone, dogmatic
Although the die is cast
Shot down, volcanic
But what is gone is gone and done
Look back, psychotic
No chance before this life began

Pre-Chorus]
Staring into black light
Dominating birthright

[Chorus]
Wrath of man
Leaching through, split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into point of view
Wrath of man
Violence, inheritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon, feeding on
Seventy-two seasons gone

[Verse 2]
Feeding on the wrath of man
Shoot back, erratic
Mad seasons take their toll
New mask, chaotic
Completely lost control
Shoot back, fanatic
Wither under looming shadow cast
Slip back, narcotic
Blinded by the ashes of the past

Pre-Chorus]
Staring into black light
Choking on the stage fright

[Chorus]
Wrath of man
Lеaching through, split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into point of view
Wrath of man
Violence, inhеritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon, feeding on
Seventy-two seasons gone

[Bridge]
Piercing through, cut in two
Polarize
Point of view crash into
Paralyze

[Verse 3]
Feeding on the wrath of man
Man down, barbaric
Quick fire machine gun thoughts
Deep seed, stigmatic
Some have and some have not
Man down, demonic
No mercy from the ghost within
Turn back, hypnotic
There's breathing out, but not back in

Pre-Chorus]
Staring into black light
Permanently midnight

[Chorus]
Wrath of man
Leaching through, split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into point of view
Wrath of man
Violence, inheritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon, feeding on
Seventy-two seasons gone

[Outro]
Feeding on the wrath of man"
3,Ain't my bitch ,"Outta my way
Outta my day 
Outta your mind and into mine 
Into no one
Into not one 
Into your step but out of time 

Head strong, what's wrong? 
I've already heard this song before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye 

Dragging me down
Why you around
So useless 
It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch 
It ain't my bitch 

Down on the sun
Down and no fun 
Down and out, where the hell you been 
Damn it all down
Damn it unbound 
Damn it all down to hell again 

Stand tall, can't fall 
Never even bend at all before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye 

Dragging me down
Why you around
So useless
It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch 

Outta my way

Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine
Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time

Head strong, what's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
You arrived, but now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye
And now it's time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around
So useless
It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch

No way but down
Why you're around
No fooling

It ain't my smile
It ain't my style
It ain't my bitch
Oh, it ain't mine

Ain't mine
Your kind
You're stepping out of time

Ain't mine
Your kind
You're stepping out of time

Taking me down
Why you around
No fooling

It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch"
4,All Nightmare Long ,"(One, Two!)

Luck. Runs. Out. 
Crawl from the wreckage one more time 
Horrific memory twists the mind 
Dark, rugged, cold and hard to turn 
Path of destruction, feel it burn 
Still alive 
Incarnation 
Still alive 
Infamy 

Hallucination 
Heresy 
Still you run, what's to come? 
What's to be? 

'Cause we hunt you down without mercy 
Hunt you down all nightmare long 
Feel us breathe upon your face 
Feel us shift, every move we trace 
Hunt you down without mercy 
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah 
Luck. Runs. 

And you crawl back in 
But your luck runs out

(One, Two!) 

Luck. Runs. Out. 

The light that is not light is here 
To flush you out with your own fear 
You hide, you hide, but will be found 
Release your grip without a sound 

Still alive 
Immolation

And you crawl back in 
But your luck runs out

Then you crawl back in 
Into your obsession 
Never to return 
This is your confession 

Hunt you down without mercy 
Hunt you down all nightmare long 
Feel us breathe upon your face 
Feel us shift, every move we trace 
Hunt you down without mercy 
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah 
Luck. Runs. 

You crawl back in 
But your luck runs out 

Your luck runs out"

6,All Your Lies (Soundgarden cover) ,"All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies

All your fears are lies

See through your
Tripless, falling, limping, crawling,
Biting, fighting, back from dying
Endless ending, comprehending
Nothing of the sin she's sinning

Loosely buying your cheating, your lying
Will make it mine
While never crying
Corralled like a cat
With my head in a sack
And I feel like I'm tied to a railroad track"
7,Am I Evil ,"My mother was a witch, she was burned alive
 Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried
 Take her down now, don't want to see her face
 All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace

 Twenty seven, everyone was nice
 Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price
 See their bodies out on the ice
 Take my time

 Am I evil?
 Yes I am
 Am I evil?
 I am man
 Yes I am

 As I watched my mother die, I lost my head
 Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread
 Takin' no chances, you come with me
 I'll split you to the bone, help set you free

 Twenty seven, everyone was nice
 Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price
 See their bodies out on the ice
 Take my time

 Am I evil?
 Yes I am
 Am I evil?
 I am man
 Yes I am

 On with the action now, I'll strip your pride
 I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride
 Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat
 Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet

 Am I evil?
 Yes I am
 Am I evil?
 I am man

 I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire
 You can come with me, sweet desire
 My face is long forgot, my face not my own
 Sweet and timely whore, take me home

 Am I evil?
 Yes I am
 Am I evil?
 I am man

 My soul is longing for, await my heir
 Sent to avenge my mother, sleep myself
 My face is long forgot, my face not my own
 Sweet and timely whore, take me home

 Am I evil?
 Yes I am
 Am I evil?
 I am man

 Am I evil?
 Yes I fucking am
 Am I evil?
 I am man"
8,Am I Savage? ,"Ooooh
Run away, the past will bite again
Ooooh
No matter where you dwell
You
Here again, a captive of the howl
You
Welcome back to hell

Faithful, as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks anger's reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore

Ooooh
Tooth is fang, twisting under skin
Ooooh
Foul tongue, black breath
Change
Snap inside, the beast about complete
Change
Soon infects the rest 

Faithful, as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks anger's reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Howling at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore

Ooooh
Inheritance, the past has bit again
Ooooh
The next heir of anarchy
Feel
Stretching skin so far beyond belief
I feel
The ever changing, you, in me

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
Howling evermore
Am I savage? 
I don't recognize you anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Am I savage?"
9,And Justice for All ,"...And Justice For All

Halls of justice painted green 
Money talking 
Power wolves beset your door 
Hear them stalking 
Soon you'll please their appetite 
They devour 
Hammer of justice crushes you 
Overpower 

The ultimate in vanity 
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe 
I can't believe the price you pay 
Nothing can save you 

Justice is lost 
Justice is raped 
Justice is gone 
Pulling your strings 
Justice is done 
Seeking no truth 
Winning is all 
Find it so grim 
So true 
So real 

Apathy their stepping stone 
So unfeeling 
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving 
Through your eyes their light burns 
Hoping to find 
Inquisition sinking you 
With prying minds 

The ultimate in vanity 
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe 
I can't believe the price you pay 
Nothing can save you 

Justice is lost 
Justice is raped 
Justice is gone 
Pulling your strings 
Justice is done 
Seeking no truth 
Winning is all 
Find it so grim 
So true 
So real 

Lady Justice has been raped 
Truth assassin 
Rolls of red tape seal your lips 
Now you're done in 
Their money tips her scales again 
Make your deal 
Just what is truth?
I cannot tell 
Cannot feel 

The ultimate in vanity 
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe 
I can't believe the price we pay 
Nothing can save us

Justice is lost 
Justice is raped 
Justice is gone 
Pulling your strings 
Justice is done 
Seeking no truth 
Winning is all 
Find it so grim 
So true 
So real
Seeking no truth 
Winning is all 
Find it so grim 
So true 
So real"
10,Astronomy ,"The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
 Out at you from their hiding place
 Like acid and oil on a madman's face
 Reason tends to fly away
 Like lesser birds on the four winds
 Like silver scrapes in May
 Now the sands become a crust
 And most of you have gone away
 Yeah, gone away

 Ah, come Susie dear, let's take a walk
 Just out there upon the beach
 I know you'll soon be married
 And you'll want to know where wind comes from
 Well it's never said at all
 On the map that Carrie reads
 Behind the clock back there you know
 At the Four Winds Bar
 Mmm yeah

 Yeah
 Hey!
 Hey!
 Hey!
 Hey!

 Four winds at the Four Winds Bar
 Two doors locked and windows barred
 One door's left to take you in
 The other one just mirrors it

 Hey!
 Hey!
 Yeah, hey!
 Yeah, hey!

 In hellish glare and inference
 The other one's a duplicate
 The queenly flux, eternal light
 Or the light that never warms
 Yes the light that never, never warms
 Yes the light that never, never warms, never warms, never warms

 The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
 Out at you from their hiding place
 Miss Carrie Nurse and Susie dear
 Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar

 It's the nexus of the crisis
 And the origin of storms
 Just the place to hopelessly
 Encounter time and then came me

 Hey!
 Hey!
 Hey!
 Hey!

 Call me Desdinova
 Eternal light
 These gravely digs of mine
 Will surely prove a sight
 And don't forget my dog
 Fixed and consequent

 Astronomy - a star
 Astronomy - a star
 Astronomy - a star

22,Brothers In Arms (Dire Straits cover) ,"These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction
Baptism of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battles raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line on your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms"

Once you provoke her, rattling on her tail

42,Dream No More ,"He sleeps under black seas waiting
Lies dreaming in death
He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breath

He wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving Earth it's bleeding
Pure madness alive

And he haunts you
And he blinds your soul
And he loathes you
And reclaims it all

You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say
Cthulhu awaken

He sways in abyss returning
Inhaling black skies
He shakes with a torture burning
All lost in his eyes 

And he haunts you
And he blinds your soul
And he loathes you
And reclaims it all

You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say
Cthulhu awaken

You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say

Sanity taken
Seething damnation
Cthulhu awaken
(Wake) Winged Salvation
Death by creation
Cthulhu awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more
Cthulhu awaken

43,Dyers Eve ,"Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through?
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call ""life""

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindly

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Time has frozen still what's left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it's life as-is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

Dear Mother
Dear Father
You've clipped my wings before
I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you,
""Do as I say, not as I do""

Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I'm living blindly

I'm in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim, please rescue me

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething
I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew"
44,Enter Sandman ,"Say your prayers little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone

Tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of snow white

Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land

Now I lay me down to sleep
(Now I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
(Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
If I die before I wake
(If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take
(Pray the Lord my soul to take)

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never land

Take my hand
Off to never never land

45,Escape ,"Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy 
I know I'm my best friend 
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger 
I'll fight until the end 
To escape from the true false world 
Undamaged destiny 
Can't get caught in the endless circle 
Ring of stupidity 

Out for my own, out to be free 
One with my mind, they just can't see 
No need to hear things that they say 
Life is for my own to live my own way 

Rape my mind and destroy my feelings 
Don't tell my what to do 
I don't care now, 'cause I'm on my side 
And I can see through you 
Feed my brain with your so called standards 
Who says that I ain't right 
Break away from your common fashion 
See through your blurry sight 

Out for my own, out to be free 
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say 
Life is for my own to live my own way 

See them try to bring the hammer down 
No damn chains can hold me to the ground 

Life is for my own to live my own way..."
46,Eye of the Beholder ,"Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence

Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must

Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?

Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me

Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative

Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own

Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself, and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself

Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom's ring

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say"
47,Fade To Black ,"Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else

I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel

Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm
Now I will just say goodbye"

Crawling from the wreckage one more time
This map is tattered, can't free the signs
Though the body's rusted,
Hard to turn
On the path of destruction, feel it burn

Feel safe, in the danger
Feel good, in the bad

Got the burning, got the speed
Lose your turn, you crash and burn, you walk away

'Cause it ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn, then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong

In love with my pain
Much needed to keep me down again
Don't allow myself to feel too good

Lose your turn, you crash and burn, you walk away

Deep in your obsession
Since you've crashed and burned
This is your confession

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away

52,For Whom The Bell Tolls ,"Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On the fight, for they are right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls"

And when the night has fallen
It falls hard and then it all begins
When she starts her calling
I feel my darkness growing from within

After everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will run straight to hell and back
Straight to hell and back

When they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always return to hell and back
Straight to hell and back
Straight to hell and back
I will run straight to hell and back

I become two
We become one
Unbridled
Unequaled
Unholy
Undone

The path is cut deep
The path is worn well
I'll follow my footsteps to the warmth of hell
The warmth of hell

After everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will run straight to hell and back
Straight to hell and back
Straight to hell and back

When they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always return to hell and back

Turn to hell and back
Straight to hell and back
Straight to hell and back
I will run straight to hell and back
Straight down"
65,Helpless ,"I gotta see you moving fast
See you come my way
See the dreams, I hope they last
Never fade away

Gotta see the lights above
Make it loud tonight
Gotta set it all a-fire
Set it all a-light

See the flashing lights
Hear the thunder roar
I am gonna set you all a-light
Gotta make it man
I ain't got a choice
Gotta fill this hall tonight

Helpless
Helpless
Helpless
Helpless

I don't what I'm gonna do
Maybe not tonight
Gotta set you all a-fire
Gotta treat you right

I can see the flashing lights
Lit before your love, oh
Gotta hear the thunder roar
Coming from above

See the flashing lights
Hear the thunder roar
I'm gonna set you all alight
Gotta make it man
I ain't got no choice
Gotta fill this hall tonight

Helpless
Helpless
Helpless
Helpless

I can see the stars
I can see what's going on

Every night alone
I sing my song just for fun

Only time will tell
If I'll make it myself someday
This stage is mine
Music is my destiny

Cannot squeeze the life from me

I can see the lights
But I can see what's going on
Every night alone
I sing my song just for fun

Business in collapse
Some men don't like it so
Helpless maybe babe
But you can leave or join the show

Cannot squeeze the life from me"
66,Here Comes Revenge ,"Little grave I'm grieving, I will mend you
Sweet revenge I'm dreaming, I will end you
I've been here since dawn of time
Countless hatreds built my shrine
I was born in anger's flame
He was Able, I was Cain
I am here
I'm hell unbound
Burn your kingdom to the ground
To the ground

Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, it's killing me
Revenge, set me free

Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof

Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge

I return this nightmare, I will find you
Sleepless, cloaked in despair, I'm behind you
Man has made me oh so strong
Blurring lines of right and wrong
Far too late for frail amends
Now it's come to sweet revenge
Desperate hands
That lose control
Have no mercy on your soul
On your soul

Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, it's killing me
Revenge, set me free

Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof

Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge

Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, it's killing me
Revenge, set me free

Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof

Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge
Sweet revenge"
67,Hero Of The Day ,"Mama, they try and break me

The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
Someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Can't you hear your babies crying?

Mama, they try and break me
Still they try and break me

Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now, deservingly, this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair

Don't want your aid
But the fist I make
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Can't you hear your names?
Can't you hear your babies crying?

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try 
Mama, they try 
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try 
Mama, they try"
68,Hi Guy ,"Like a siren in my head and there is
No emergency
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face 
That learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite

Like a hurt that keeps me focused
Though I think i've gone astray
Like a low grade nightmare that
I must awaken from each day
Like a dream
A beautiful dream
Not worthy of, so I deny…

You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
You never open them, so it passed you by
You close your eyes, so you may never fall from grace
You open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is this so hard?
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went,
Almost like your life

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a spring that cannot be in current till
It's time to drink
Like a puzzle
With missing pieces
And the box is thrown away

Like a release from a prison 
That you didn't know you're in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed 
To leave
From way back then
Like a general
Without a mission
Until the war will start again…

You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
You never open them, so it passed you by
You close your eyes, so you may never fall from grace
You open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is this so hard?
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went,
Almost like your life

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a touch from heaven on this breeze
That brings you straight down to your knees

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a touch from heaven on this breeze
That brings you straight down to your knees

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is this so hard?
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went,
Almost like your life
That was just your life"

70,Holier Than Thou ,"No more!
The craps rolls out your mouth again
Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatin
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about yourself instead?

Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
Gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are

You know not

Before you judge me take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand

It's not who you are, it's who you know
Others lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges and build them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou 
You are
You know not

Yeah, who the hell are you?

Holier than thou

Come squeeze the world and drip it down my throat again
Down my throat again

You got to breathe, man, breathe
Coming up for air
Breathe, man, breathe
Coming up for air

Touch me so I think I'm here
Skin my senses
Barely breathing, minus human
Just squeeze the world and drip it down my throat again
Down my throat again

You got to breathe, man, breathe
Coming up for air
Breathe, man, breathe

73,Iced Honey (with Lou Reed) ,"You can’t put a butterfly in a jar
If the effort’s too high no matter who you are
You can’t catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn’t matter who you are
Iced honey
Now me I’ve tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honey
If I can’t trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can’t keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honey
If you can’t put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb
If it’s all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long
If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you’re all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start
And me, I’ve always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can’t put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy
If you can’t put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like Hell, the river Styx
Your affection never sticks
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There’s nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honey"
74,If Darkness Had a Son ,"Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

The beast still shouts for what it's yearning
He stokes the fire, desire burning
The never-ending quenchless craving
The unforgiving misbehaving

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

So paint your eyes as black as sorrow
Hide yourself behind tomorrow
The nightmares search for infiltration
In domination, captivation

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Return again to where it's darkest
Dragging home this heathen harvest
And all the children subjugated
Manipulated, propagated

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water

If darkness had a son
Here I am
If darkness had a son
Here I am
If darkness had a son
Here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be"

76,Iron man ,"(I am Iron man)

Has he lost his mind? 
Can he see or is he blind? 
Can he walk at all, 
Or if he moves will he fall? 
Is he alive or dead? 
Has he thoughts within his head? 
We'll just pass him there 
why should we even care? 

He was turned to steel 
in the great magnetic field 
When he traveled time 
for the future of mankind 

Nobody wants him 
He just stares at the world 
Planning his vengeance 
that he will soon unfold 

Now the time is here 
for Iron Man to spread fear 
Vengeance from the grave 
Kills the people he once saved 

Nobody wants him 
They just turn their heads 
Nobody helps him 
Now he has his revenge 

Heavy boots of lead 
fills his victims full of dread 
Running as fast as they can 
Iron Man lives again!"

Jožin z bažin močálem se plíží,
Jožin z bažin k vesnici se blíží,

Jožin z bažin kouše, saje, rdousí.
Na Jožina z bažin, koho by to napadlo,

All drowning in the blame
All reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver

All hide beneath the skin
All hopes so paper thin
I'm at the door again
And the shine of the midnight revolver

Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a .45

Suck on the barrel
Suck on the barrel
Suck it 'til it's gone dry

For all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver

Redemption purify
Will nothing satisfy
The scars just multiply
In the shine of the midnight revolver

Twisting in apocalypse
Death upon the fingertips
Frigid metal touches lips
And the shine of the midnight revolver

'Cause you lied

Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leaving you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my head

Caressing death again
Becomes the heroin
Forbidden medicine
Puts a shine on the midnight revolver

Eternal borderline
All the faces intertwine
Oh God, now I see mine
In the shine of the midnight revolver

Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a .45

Suck on the barrel
Suck on the barrel
Suck, suck 'till it's dry

For all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver

Down in misery
Down in misery

Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leaving you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my head

All roads they lead to shame
All drowning in the blame
Reflections look the same

Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a .45

Suck on the barrel
Suck on the barrel
Suck, suck 'till it's dry

Do all reflections look the same

81,Justice Medley ,"[Eye of the Beholder: Instrumental Intro]

[Blackened: 1st Bridge (alt L4)]
Opposition - Contradiction
Premonition - Compromise
Agitation - Violation
Masturbation... On our face
Darkest color: Blistered Earth... True death of life

[Frayed Ends of Sanity: Verse 1]
Never hunger - Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure...
Struggle within triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends...

[And Justice For All: Verse 1]
Halls of Justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of Justice crushes you, overpower

[AJFA: Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you


[AJFA: Chorus]
Justice is lost - Justice is raped - Justice is gone
Pulling your strings... Justice is done
Seeking no truth - Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[AJFA: Verse 2]
Apathy, their stepping stone, so unfeeling
Hidden, deep animosity, so deceiving
Thru your eyes, their light burns, hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

[AJFA: Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

[AJFA: Chorus]
Justice is lost - Justice is raped - Justice is gone
Pulling your strings... Justice is done
Seeking no truth - Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[Blackened: Verse 1]
Blackened is the end - Winter it will send
Throwing all you see into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth - Never a rebirth
Evolution's end - Never will it mend... Never


[Blackened: Chorus]
Fire, to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

[Blackened: Chorus (alt)]
Fire is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of Humanity
Color our world blackened! Blackened!"

 You said bad words, threw rocks at the bird
 And now, this is your hotel!
 You ain't going back, this ain't disneyland, it's Hell!

 Little boy, it's time for you to pay!
 For hurting that bird, and not going to church
 And staring at boobs everyday
 Now you must stand in Hell! 

 Hell isn't good, Hell isn't good, Hell!
 No, Hell isn't good, Hell isn't good, Hell!

 Mahatma Ghandi: There is orderliness the universe

83,Killing Time ,"The sound of gunfire goes through the night
 The killing and hatred's a terrible sight
 Reports come in of a heavy attack
 Message received, we're moving back

 Preparations are made for the journey back
 Hints on survival, supplies are packed
 No more nights in this eternal hall
 Destination is simple, we move out

 Killing time, your life's on the line
 Killing time, your turn to kill
 Killing time, what'd ya say?
 Killing time, ah killing time

 Ingenuity needed to keep us alive
 No time for cowardice, kill & survive
 Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
 Nasty word, he'll take your life


 The silence is over the attack again
 The killing & hatred, drive me insane
 Reports come in of a savage attack
 Message received, we're moving back"

And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around

Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name

Where's your crown King Nothing?
Where's your crown?

I want that star, I want it now
I want it all and I don't care how

Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish
You may regret it
Careful what you wish
You just might get it

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around

Just want one thing

No, you're just nothing
Absolutely nothing

I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead

I got something to say
I raped your mother today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as she's spread
Sweet lovely death
I am waiting for your breath
Come sweet death, one last caress

Sweet lovely death
I am waiting for your breath
Come sweet death, one last caress

Well, I got something to say
I killed your baby today
And it doesn't matter much to me
As long as it's dead

Sweet lovely death
I am waiting for your breath
Come sweet death
One last caress"

sucked into the part 
Circus comes to town, 
you play the lead clown
Please, please 
Spreading his disease, 
living by his story 
Knees, knees 
Falling to your knees, 
suffer for his glory 
You will 

Time for lust, time for lie 
Time to kiss your life goodbye 
Send me money, send me green 
Heaven you will meet 
Make a contribution, and you'll get a better seat
Bow to leper messiah 

Marvel at his tricks, 
need your sunday fix 
Blind devotion came, 
rotting your brain 
Chain, chain 
Join the endless chain,
 taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame 
Infection is the game, 
stinking drunk with power 
We see 

Time for lust, time for lie 
Time to kiss your life goodbye 
Send me money, send me green 
Heaven you will meet 
Make a contribution, and you'll get a better seat
Bow to leper messiah 

Witchery, weakening 
See the sheeps are gathering 
Set the trap, hypnotize 
Now you follow 

Time for lust, time for lie 
Time to kiss your life goodbye 
Send me money, send me green 
Heaven you will meet 
Make a contribution, and you'll get a better seat

87,Let it Loose (Savage Cover) ,"Who's that woman on your arm all dressed up to do you harm
And I'm hip to what she'll do, give her just about a month or two
Bit off more than I can chew and I knew what it was leading to
Some things, well, I can't refuse
One of them, one of them the bedroom blues
She delivers right on time, I can't resist a corny line
But take the shine right off you shoes
Carryin', carryin' the bedroom blues
In the bar you're getting drunk, I ain't in love, I ain't in luck
Hide the switch and shut the light, let it all come down tonight
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
some face you'll never see no more

Let it all come down tonight
Keep those tears hid out of sight, let it loose, let it all come dow"

90,Low Man's Lyric ,"One, two, three, one

My eyes seek reality 
My fingers seek my veins 
There's a dog at your back step
He must come in from the rain 
I fall 'cause I let go 
The net below has rot away 
So my eyes seek reality 
And my fingers seek my veins 

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm 
And I can't bear to see 
What I've let me be 
So wicked and worn 

So as I write to you 
Of what is done and to do 
Maybe you'll understand 
And won't cry for this man 
'Cause low man is due 

Please forgive me 

My eyes seek reality 
My fingers feel for faith 
Touch clean with a dirty hand 
I touched the clean to the waste 

The trash fire is warm 
But nowhere safe from the storm 
And I can't bear to see 
What I've let me be 
So wicked and worn 

So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do 
Maybe you'll understand 
And won't cry for this man 
'Cause low man is due 

Please forgive me 
Please forgive me 
Please forgive me 

So low the sky is all I see 
All I want from you is forgive me 
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain 
Though he just wants right back out again 

And I cry to the alley way 
Confess all to the rain 
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror 
The one I've broken to match my face 

The trash fire is warm 
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see 
What I've let me be 
So wicked and worn 

So as I write to you 
Of what is done and to do 
Maybe you'll understand 
And won't cry for this man 
'Cause low man is due 

Please forgive me 
Please forgive me 

So low the sky is all I see 
All I want from you is forgive me 
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain 
Though he just wants right back out again 

My eyes seek reality 
My fingers seek my veins"

Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young:
""Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore it's done""
""The brightest flame burns quickest"" 
That's what I heard her say
Son's heart sowed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still 
Yeah, still

Rebel - my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains

Left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
but what is said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I asked of you 
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you 
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son 
Unspoken, help me be
Yeah, I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me, yeah.
I need your arms to welcome me
but a cold stone's all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still
Oh, oh, oh, woah

Never I asked of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I asked of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still"

It’s you I’m madly fighting for
When kingdom comes, may it be

Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there is not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much
too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, help me

Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine has 
Taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell"

128,Ronnie Rising (A Tribute to Ronnie James Dio) ,"Rainbow-Tarot Woman

I don't wanna go 
Something tells me no, no, no, no 
But traces in the sand 
The lines inside my hand say go go go 

Beware of a place 
A smile on a bright shiny face 
I'll never return, how do you know 
Tarot woman, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

She can take you there 
The entrance to the fair, my, my, my 
Ride the carousel 
Cast a magic spell, fly, fly, fly

Beware of a place 
A smile on a bright shiny face 
I'll never return, how do you know 
Tarot woman, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

Rainbow-Stargazer

High noon, oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides, why he's lighter than air?
Oh I see his face!

Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
I believe, I believe, yes, I believe

In the heat and the rain
With the whips and chains
To see him fly
So many die
We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
But we don't know why
Now where do we go?

131,Screaming Suicide ,"Welcome to this life
Born into the fight
Here to claim your dream
Look you in the eye
Patch the broken sky
Craving dopamine
Then my voice appears
Teaching you of fears
Are you good enough?
You don't recognize
Head is full of lies
You should just give up

Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well

Don't ever speak my name
Remеmber you're to blame
Keep mе inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide

Curse another day
Spirit locked away
Punish and deprive
Hate to be awake
Living a mistake
More dead than alive
Then a voice appears
Whisper in your ears
“You are good enough”
Throwing down a rope
A lifeline of hope
Never give you up

Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well

Don't ever speak my name
Remember you're to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide

Terrified in sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you're left behind

My lying voice inside
Keeps drinking cyanide
And no more can you run
Into the sun

Terrified, sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you're left behind

And now you speak my name
You've given back the blame
Keep me deep inside
Don't you keep me inside
Screaming suicide

Now that I'm exposed inside
Shined a light on cyanide
I'm no longer needed here
Now you've faced your biggest fear"

148,That Was Just Your Life ,"Like a siren in my head 
That always threatens to repeat
Like a blind man 
That is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face that learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite
Like a misery that keeps me focused 
Though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare 
That I must awaken from each day
Like conviction
A premonition
Not worthy of so I deny 
I deny

I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse, the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life 

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding 
To remind me not to think
Like a raging river drowning 
When I only need a drink
Like a poison that I swallow
But I want the world to die
Like a release from a prison 
That I didn't know was in
Like a fight to live the past 
I prayed to leave from way back then
Like a general without a mission 
Until the war will start again
Start again 

I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse, the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Like a touch from hell 
To feel how hot that it can get 
If you get caught
Like a strike from heaven turns that key 
And brings you straight down to your knees
Like a touch from hell 
To feel how hot that it can get 
If I get caught
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve 
That brings you straight down to your knees

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse, the day is long
Realize you don't belong
Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

That was just your life"

150,The Day That Never Comes ,"Born to push you around
Better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the ground
Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waiting

Waiting for the One
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no...
No the sunshine never comes

Push you cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hideing yourself
Crawling yourself
You'll have your time
God, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray

Waiting for the One
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes.

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison
I suffer this no longer
I put it into this I swear
This I swear, the sun will shine
This I swear
This I swear
This I swear"

153,The Four Horsemen ,"By the last breath of the fourth winds blow 
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knocks at your door
Lock up your wife and children now 
It's time to wield the blade 
For now you've got some company 

The Horsemen are drawing nearer 
On the leather steeds they ride 
They've come to take your life 
On through the dead of night 
With the four Horsemen ride 
Or choose your fate and die 

You have been dying since the day you were born 
You know it has all been planned 
The quartet of deliverance rides 
A sinner once a sinner twice 
No need for confession now 
Cause now you have got the fight of your life 

The Horsemen are drawing nearer 
On the leather steeds they ride 
They've come to take your life 
On through the dead of night 
With the four Horsemen ride 
Or choose your fate and die 

Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine 
Your body it has torn through 
Withered in every place
Pestilence 
For what you have had to endure 
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
Now there is nothing you can do

So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds 
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong 
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor blood, guts and sweat

The Horsemen are drawing nearer 
On the leather steeds they ride 
They've come to take your life 
On through the dead of night 
With the four Horsemen ride 
Or choose your fate and die"
154,The Frayed Ends of Sanity ,"Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure

Struggle within 
Triggered again 
Now the candle burns at both ends 

Twisting under schizophrenia 
Falling deep into dementia 

Old habits reappear 
Fighting the fear of fear 
Growing conspiracy 
Everyone's after me 
Frayed ends of sanity 
Hear them calling 
Hear them calling me 

Birth of terror
Death of much more
I'm the slave of fear, my captor 

Never warnings 
Spreading its wings 
As I wait for the horror she brings 

Loss of interest, question, wonder 
Waves of fear they pull me under 

Old habits reappear 
Fighting the fear of fear 
Growing conspiracy 
Everyone's after me 
Frayed ends of sanity 
Hear them calling 
Hear them calling me 

Into ruin 
I am sinking 
Hostage of this nameless feeling 
Hell is set free 
Flooded I'll be 
Feel the undertow inside me 
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension 
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression 

Old habits reappear 
Fighting the fear of fear 
Growing conspiracy 
Myself is after me 
Frayed ends of sanity 
Hear them calling 
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling 
Hear them calling me"

Close my eyes
Find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes
Just to have them close again
Well on my way
But on my way to where I've been

It swallows me
As it takes me in its fog
I twist away
As I give this world the nod

Open door so I walk inside
Close my eyes
Find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes
Just to have them close once again
Don't want control
As it takes me down and down and down again

Is that the moon ?
Or just the light that lights this dead end street?
Is that you there?
Or just another demon that I meet?

The higher you are
The further you fall
The longer the walk
The further you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple it tilts
Step into the house that Jack built

The higher you are
The further you fall
The longer the walk
The further you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple it tilts
Yes, this the house that Jack built

Open door as I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take the sin
Let the show begin
Let the show begin
Let the show begin

The longer the walk
The further you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple it tilts

157,The Judas Kiss ,"When the world has turned its back
When the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone

        So, what now?
        Where do I head?

When you think it's all said and done
When you are the ostracized
Selfish ridden dead goodbyes
Twisting on the tourniquet
When the pieces never fit

        So, what now?
        Where do I head?

When you think it's all said and done

        Bow down
        Sell your soul to me

        Pacify your demons

        Surrender unto me

        Sanctify your demons

        Into abyss,

        Cannot resist,

When the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame

        So, what now?

When you think it's all said and done

Venom of a life insane
Bites into your fragile vein
Internalize and decimate 
Patronize and complicate

        Cannot resist,
        The Judas kiss

Judas lives, recite this vow
I've become your new god now

Followed you from dawn of time
Whispered thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured your children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown
In the heart of feeble man
Plant the seed of my own plan
The strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all...
Inside you all

        So, bow down
        Sell your soul to me
        I will set you free
        Pacify your demons

I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns

See his face, see his smile
Time to die

I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay
I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry
And I will burn in hell, from the day I die

Come lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again,
She lay beside me but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black hearts scarring darker still, yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there

Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it

        What I've felt, what I've known
        Turn the pages, turn the stone
       Behind the door, should I open it for you?

       What I've felt, what I've known
       So sick and tired, I stand alone
       Could you be there? 'Cause I'm the one who waits
       The one who waits for you

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

What I've felt, what I've known
I'll take this key
And I bury it in you
Because you're unforgiven, too

Never free
Never me
'Cause you're unforgiven, too"
169,The unforgiven II [deutsche] ,"Leg dich neben mich, sag mir was sie getan haben
Sag die Worte, die ich hören will, damit meine Dämonen verschwinden
Die Tür ist zwar verschlossen, aber sie ist offen, wenn du die Wahrheit sagst
Wenn du mich verstehen kannst, dann kann ich auch dich verstehen

Leg dich neben mich, unter dem schlechten Himmel
Der schwarze Tag, die dunkle Nacht, wir teilen uns diese Lähmung
Die Tür schlägt auf, doch es scheint keine Sonne hindurch
Das schwarze Herz erschrickt immer noch in der Finsternis
Nein, es scheint keine Sonne hindurch
Nein, es scheint keine Sonne

Bridge:
Was ich gefühlt habe, was ich wusste
Die Seiten wenden sich, der Stein dreht sich um
Ich steh hinter der Tür, sollte ich sie für dich öffnen? ...

Chorus:
Was ich gefühlt habe, was ich wusste
Krank und müde, ich bin allein
Könntest du da sein, denn ich bin der einzige, der auf der dich wartet
Oder bist du auch eine von den Unverzeihlichen?

Leg dich neben mich, das wird nicht wehtun, ich schwörs
Sie liebt mich nicht, sie liebt mich immer noch, aber sie wird nie mehr lieben
Sie liegt neben mir und sie wird da sein, wenn ich gegangen bin
Ich bin mir da todessicher, sie wird da sein

Bridge
Chorus

Leg dich neben mich, sag mir was ich getan habe
Die Tür ist geschlossen, so wie deine Augen
Aber jetzt seh ich die Sonne, jetzt seh ich die Sonne
Ja nun seh ich sie

Was ich gefühlt habe, was ich wusste
Die Seiten wenden sich, der Stein dreht sich um
Ich steh hinter der Tür, sollte ich sie für dich öffnen? ...
Was ich gefühlt habe, was ich wusste
Krank und müde, ich bin allein
Könntest du da sein, denn ich bin der einzige, der wartet
Der einzige, der auf dich wartet "

By the light of golden treasure
Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
His sinking life
Outside it's hell
Inside intoxicating
He's run aground
Like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast
Down with his ship
Fading in the shadows 
Now a castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

Forgive me

Siódma rano - to dla mnie noc,
Pracować nie chciałem, włóczyłem się.

Za to do puszki zamykano mnie.
Za to zwykle zamykano mnie.
Po knajpach grywałem za piwko i chleb,
Na szyciu bluesa tak mijał mi dzień.

Tylko nocą do klubu ""Puls""
Jam-session do rana, tam królował blues
To już minęło, ten klimat, ten luz.
Wspaniali ludzie nie powrócą,
Nie powrócą już!

Tylko nocą do klubu ""Puls""

Wspaniali ludzie nie powrócą,
Nie powrócą już!"
189,Welcome Home (Sanitarium) ,"Welcome to where time stands still 
No one leaves and no one will 
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged 

Dream the same thing every night 
I see our freedom in my sight 
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred 

Sleep my friend and you will see 
The dream is my reality 
They keep me locked up in this cage 
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage

Sanitarium, leave me be 
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there 
Cannot breathe the open air 
Whisper things into my brain 
Assuring me that I'm insane 

They think our heads are in their hands 
But violent use brings violent plans 
Keep him tied, it makes him well 
He's getting better, can't you tell? 

No more can they keep us in 
Listen, damn it, we will win 
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell 

Sanitarium, leave me be 
Sanitarium, just leave me alone 
Sanitarium, just leave me alone 

Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now 
Mutiny in the air 
Got some death to do 

Mirror stares back hard 
Kill, it's such a friendly word 
Seems the only way 
For reaching out again"
190,When a Blind Man Cries ,"If you’re leaving close the door
Not expecting people anymore
Hear me grieving, lying on the floor
Whether drunk or dead, I really ain’t too sure

I’m a blind man
I’m a blind man and my world is pale
When a blind man cries
Lord, You know there ain’t no sadder tale

Had a friend once in a room
Had a good time but it ended much too soon
In a cold month in that room
Found a reason for the things we had to do

I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man, now my room is cold
When a blind man cries
Lord, You know he feels it from his soul

I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man and my world is pale
When a blind man cries
Lord, You know there ain't no sadder tale"
191,Where The Wild Things Are ,"So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world

Steal dreams and give to you
Shoplift a thought or two
All children touch the sun
Burn fingers one by one, by one

Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war

Big eyes to open soon
Believing all under sun and moon
But does heaven know you're here?
And did they give you smiles or tears?
No, no tears

Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war

You swing your rattle down
(Hand puppets storm the beach
Fire trucks trapped out of reach)
Call to arms, the trumpets sound
(Hand puppets storm the beach
Fire trucks trapped out of reach
All clowns reinforce the rear
Slingshots fire into the air)
Toy horses start the charge
(All clowns reinforce the rear
Slingshots fire into the air
Stuffed bears hold the hill till death
Crossfire from the marionettes)
Robot chessmen standing guard
(Stuffed bears hold the hill till death
Crossfire from the marionettes
We shall never surrender)

All you children touch the sun
Burn your fingers one by one
Will this earth be good to you?
Keep you clean or stain through?

So wake up, sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are
Toy soldiers off to war
Off to war
Off to war

So close your little eyes"
192,Wherever I May Roam ,"(...and the road becomes my bride)
...and the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need

...and with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will

But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home

(...and the earth becomes my throne)
...and the earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one

...and my ties are severed clean
The less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home

But I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home

Carved upon my stone
My body lie, but still I roam
Yeah yeah!

Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Woah

Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Yeah!

Wherever I may wander, wander, wander
Wherever I may roam

Yeah, yeah, wherever I may roam

Yeah, yeah, wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam"
193,Whiplash ,"Late at night, all systems go, you've come to see the show 
We do our best, you're the rest, you make it real, you know 
There is a feeling deep inside that drives you fucking mad 
A feeling of a hammerhead, you need it oh so bad 

Adrenaline starts to flow 
You're thrashing all around 
Acting like a maniac 
Whiplash 

Bang your head against the stage like you never did before 
Make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore 
In a frenzied madness with your leather and your spikes 
Heads are bobbing all around, it's hot as hell tonight 

Adrenaline starts to flow 
You're thrashing all around 
Acting like a maniac 
Whiplash 

Here onstage the Marshall noise is piercing through your ears 
It kicks your ass, kicks your face, exploding feeling nears 
Now's the time to let it rip, to let it fucking loose 
We're gathered here to maim and kill 'cause this is what we choose 

Adrenaline starts to flow 
You're thrashing all around 
Acting like a maniac 

Here we go!

Whiplash 

The show is through, the metal's gone, it's time to hit the road 
Another town, another gig, again we will explode 
Hotel rooms and motorways, life out here is raw 
But we'll never stop, we'll never quit, 'cause we're Metallica 

Adrenaline starts to flow 
You're thrashing all around 
Acting like a maniac"
194,Whiskey In The Jar ,"As I was going over
The Cork and Kerry Mountains 
I saw Captain Farrell
And his money he was countin' 
I first produced my pistol
And then produced my rapier 
I said ""Stand and deliver
Or the devil he may take ya"" 

I took all of his money
And it was a pretty penny 
I took all of his money
Yeah and I brought it home to Molly 
She swore that she loved me
No never would she leave me 
But the devil take that woman
Yeah, for you know she tricked me easy 

Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o 
Whack for my daddy-o 
There's whiskey in the jar-o 

Being drunk and weary
I went to Molly's chamber 
Takin' my money with me
And I never knew the danger 
For about six or maybe seven
In walked Captain Farrell 
I jumped up, fired my pistols
And I shot him with both barrels 

Musha rain dum a doo dum a da, ha, ya 
Whack for my daddy-o 
Whack for my daddy-o 
There's whiskey in the jar-o 

Yeah, whiskey, yo, whiskey... 
Oh-oh, ya 

Now some men like a fishin'
But some men like the fowlin' 
Some men like to hear
To hear the cannonball a-roarin' 
But me, I like sleepin'
`Specially in my Molly's chamber 
But here I am in prison
Here I am with a ball and chain, yeah 

Musha rain dum a doo dum a da, ha, ya 
Whack for my daddy-o 
Whack for my daddy-o 
There's whiskey in the jar-o 
Whiskey in the jar-o

Musha rain dum-a-doo dum-a-da 
Musha rain dum-a-doo dum-a-da, hey 
Musha rain dum-a-doo dum-a-da 
Musha rain dum-a-doo dum-a-da, ya"
