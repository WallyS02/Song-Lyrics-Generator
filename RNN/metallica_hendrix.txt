Hurrah, I awake from yesterday
Alive, but the war is here to stay
So my love, Catherina and me,
decide to take our last walk through the noise to the sea
Not to die but to reborn,
away from lands so battered and torn
Forever, forever

Oh say, can you see it's really such a mess
Every inch of Earth is a fighting nest
Giant pencil and lipstick tube shaped things,
Continue to rain and cause screaming pain
And the arctic stains from silver blue to bloody red
as our feet find the sand,
and the sea is straight ahead, straight up ahead

Well it's too bad that our friends, can't be with us today
Well it's too bad
The machine, that we built,
would never save us', that's what they say

(That's why they ain't coming with us today)
And they also said it's impossible for a man to live and breathe under
water, forever,
was their main complaint
And they also threw this in my face, they said:
Anyway, you know good and well it would be beyond the will of God,
and the grace of the King (grace of the King)
(Yeah, yeah)

So my darling and I make love in the sand,
to salute the last moment ever on dry land
Our machine, it has done its work, played its part well
Without a scratch on our bodies and we bid it farewell
Starfish and giant foams greet us with a smile
Before our heads go under we take a last look at the killing noise
Of the out of style, the out of style, out of style(oooh)...
For fifty years they've been married
They can't wait for their fifty first
To roll around, yeah, roll around.
For thirty years they've been married
And now they're old and happy
And they settle down, ha ha
Settle down, yeah.
For twenty years they've been married
And they did everything that could be done
You know, they have their fun.

And then you come along and talk about it:
'So you, you say you wanna be married,
I'm gonna change your mind.
Oh, gotta change it.'
That was the good side baby
Here comes the best side.
For ten years they've been married
A thousand kids went around homeless
'Cause their Mom was a louse
Daddy's down at the whisky house.
That ain't all,
For three years they've been married
They don't get along so good,
They're tired of each other.
You know how that goes,
She got another lover.
Hah, same old thing.
So now you're seventeen
You run around hangin' out
And having your fun
Life for you has just begun baby.

And then you come sayin':
'So you, you say you wanna be married.
Oh, baby, tryin' to put me on a chain
Ain't that some shame?
You must be losin' your weak little mind.
I ain't ready to get married,
I ain't ready.
I'm gonna change your mind.
Ooh, look out baby.
Auh, I ain't ready to get tied down
I ain't ready, I ain't ready now
Let me live a little while longer
Let me live, let me live a little while longer
So I can finish talking,
Let me get back to my groove
Well there ain't no hu
Ain't no telling baby
When you will see me again
But I pray it will be tomorrow.

Well the sunrise
Is burnin' my eyes baby
Well now I must leave now
But I really hope to see you tomorrow.

Yeah well my house is oh, such a million miles away
The feelin' there always hangs up my day
Oh Cleopatra, she's driving me insane
She's tryin' to put my body in her brain
So uh, just uh, kiss me goodbye, just to ease the pain.

Sing it, hah, sing it, hah !

Ain't no, ain't no telling baby
There ain't no telling baby
When you're gonna see me
'Cause I really hope that uh, it'll be tomorrow
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Wooo, yeah
Hope it'll be ah, hope it'll be tomorrow, ah
Ain't no tellin' baby
Yeah, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Anyway, must leave now.
There must be some kind of way outta here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief

Business men, they drink my wine
Plowman dig my earth
None were level on the mind
Nobody up at his word
Hey, hey

No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But, uh, but you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us stop talkin' falsely now
The hour's getting late, hey

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
Angel came down from heaven yesterday 
She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me 
And she told me a story yesterday 
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea 
Then she spread her wings over me 
She said she's gonna come back tomorrow 
And I said "Fly on, my sweet Angel 
Fly on to the sky 
Fly on, my sweet Angel 
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side 

Sure enough, this woman came home to me 
Silver wings silhouetted against a child's sunrise 
And my Angel, she said into me 
"Today is the day for you to rise 
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man 
You're gonna rise" 
Then she took me high over younder 
And I said "Fly on, my sweet Angel 
Fly on to the sky 
Fly on, my sweet Angel 
Forever  I'm gonna be by your side
[Verse 1: ZAYN]
Angel came down from Heaven yesterday
She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she is going to come back tomorrow

[Chorus: ZAYN]
And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow, I'm gonna be by your side"

[Verse 2: ZAYN]
Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel, she said unto me
"Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you are gonna be my man, you are going to rise"
And then she took me high over yonder

[Chorus: ZAYN]
And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side
If you can just get your mind together 
uh-then come on across to me 
We'll hold hands and then we'll 
watch the sunrise 
from the bottom of the sea 
But first, are you experienced? 
Uh-have you ever been experienced-uh? 
Well, I have 

(Well) I know, I know, you'll probably scream and cry 
that your little world won't let you go 
But who in your measly little world, (-uh) 
are you tryin' to prove to that you're 
made out of gold and-uh, can't be sold 
So-uh, are you experienced? 
Have you ever been experienced? (-uh) 
Well, I have 
Uh, let me prove it to you, 
yeah 

Trumpets and violins I can-uh, hear in the distance 
I think they're callin' our name 
Maybe now you can't hear them, 
but you will, ha-ha, if you just 
take hold of my hand 
Ohhh, but are you experienced? 
Have you ever been experienced? 

Not necessarily stoned, but 
beautiful
A little boy inside a dream just the other day 
His mind fell out of his face and the wind blew it away 
A hand came out from heaven and pinned a badge on his chest 
And said get out there, man, and do your best 

They called him Astro Man and he's flying higher than 
That old faggot Superman ever could 
And they call his cosmic Nut 
And he's twice as fast as Donald Duck 
And he'll try his best to screw you up and mess your mind 

He's gonna blow out the rest of your mind 
If you're looking for a piece of mind 
Astro Man, give me a piece of it...

Yeah, sing a song, Bro'

If the sun refuse to shine,
I don't mind,
I don't mind,
If the mountains fell in the sea,
Let it be,
It ain't me.

Alright, 'cos I got my own world to look through,
And I ain't gonna copy you.

Now if, ah, 6 turned out to be 9,
I don't mind, I don't mind,
Alright, if the hippies cut off all their hair,
I don't care, I don't care.

Dig, 'cos I got my own world to live through
And I ain't gonna copy you.

White collared conservative flashing down the street,
Pointing their plastic finger at me.
They're hoping soon my kind will drop and die,
But I'm gonna wave my freak flag high, high.
Wave on, wave on
Fall mountains, just don't fall on me
Go ahead on Mr. Business man, you can't dress like me.
Sing on Brother, play on drummer
You got me sitting up on the shelf
while you're out bewitching someone else.
Do I live, Do I die
Do I laugh, Do I cry
What game am I supposed to loose this time ?


You got chains attached to my head
You spreading magic honey all in your bed
What is it you want ?
Just a puppet that talks
or maybe just a lover who makes love to the Dead.

Step onto the stage...Just a few more minutes...
Let's see what kind of juggler you really are.
Say without that whip and those Bloody Boots
which are rented...You actually could become
a morning star...
But you rang your last bell
Even your planets, they've gone to hell
And your world turns to nothing but a bubble
in a shotgun jar.
And now you don't know who you really are.


So instead of trying to make me your slave
Why don't you just...call it a day.
Either way I'm gonna win
So save yourself some wind
Don't make me to be the last to see
you to your grave...
Well well, Ball and Chain...for sale.
New day come...Masters gone to Hell...
Well well, Ball and Chain...for sale.
Sunrise come...Master's dying in Hell.
Well. I'm up here in this womb
I'm looking all around
Well, I'm looking out my belly button window
And I see a whole lot of frowns
And I'm wondering if they don't want me around

What seems to be the fuzz out there?
Just what seems to be the hang?
'Cause you know if ya just don't want me this time around,
yeah I'll be glad to go back to Spirit Land
And even take a longer rest,
before I'm coming down the chute again
Man, I sure remember the last time, baby
They were stlll hawkin' about me then
So if you don't want me now,
Make up your mind, where or when
If you don't want me now,
Give or take, you only got two hundred days
'Cause I ain't coming down this way too much more again

You know they got pills for ills and thrills and even spills
But I think you're just a little too late
So I'm coming down into this world, daddy
Regardless of love and hate
And I'm gonna sit up in your bed, mama
And just a grin right in your face
And then I'm gonna eat up all your chocolates,
and say "I hope I'm not too late"

So if there's any questions,
make up your mind
'Cause you better give or take
Questions in your mind
Give it a take,
you only got two hundered days

Way up into this womb
looking all around
Sure's dark in here
And I'm looking out my belly button window
And I swear I see nothing but a lot of frowns
And I'm wondering if they want me around
Black is Gold is pure
And true kings of this Earth.

So I say it's up to us to straighten
out this mess...
We got to go through Hell...
And then that's the last of this
miserable test...


Black must be Bold
Because it's Gold and true
kings of this world...
So let them go to the moon.
Yes let them go to Mars.
Because deep down inside
they're really from the stars.


That's why they don't want
us to mix...just the way
the Word of God had said.
So let them go to Saturn...that's
where they'll learn instead.
Because Black and White
together is right...
And White by itself is
an egotistic elf.


So they show you how to
kill...and if you don't
they will.
What do they know about
happiness...
How can they about life...
They just got lost in Space.
So when they landed,
Atlantis cried.

So if they're so alone try
to make them feel at home.
So let them fetch you fire wood.
And let them nibble on the bone.
So invent a word called Love.
And then they blame our mistakes on God.
Don't you know how lonely they must be.
So many light years from home.
Hey Soulful people I'm calling.
Don't be no more slaves.
Because God will protect us
when it comes to doomsday.
Realize before it's too late...
that NO ONE on Earth will escape.
We are the kings of Earth.
And AXIS gonna put them slaves...
They killed so many worlds before.
But they will pass sentence upon themselves...
When the Earth opens up...will
they be saved from our hell.

I feel the TRUTH of LIFE.
We better all realize...
People like me and you
We feel so bad, don't know
what to do... they keep us
High low on drugs.
And they got us making their Rugs...
As we go dripping blood.
But the Sun knows as
the wind blows and the
fire grows towards the
far shores and the water
foams to make steamed
Bones of all of those who don't belive that...
Black is Gold is the kings of this world.
We all better get our places
before God tells us to our
face WE ARE...PAST the Human Race.
Let�s pray that we all agree
we got to straighten out the family tree.
Life is for you and me togather.
That�s the way it was meant to be.
White man watch your mouth
because our Drums, they face the South.
And you can�t kill the God
that kept you alive between
the poles of the north and south.
You better adjust your place
in this world...Before your
hair, it starts to curl...and the
yellow, red, and Black of this
world will tear your ass and soul apart.

Where is he coming from ?
from Heaven where 1,000,000
worlds are one.
Where is he going to ?
He's going to make contact
with the living and the dead...
Here comes Black Gold...
Gather round young and old...
He�'going to be felt by the
Timid and the Bold...
within a wink of an eye,

With the wink of an eye
Egos swell, bust and die...
Kingdoms fall and cry...
With the wink of an eye...
With the wink of an eye
a new born baby cries...
and a 100 soldiers die with
the wink of an eye
People, people 
Here me go 
You know what it means to be left alone 
Yeah, people hear me people 
Do you know what it means to be left alone? 
Not even a love to call your own 
A little understandin' 
Lord that's all in the world I need 
Understandin' and a little bit of lovin' baby 
That's all in the world I need 
A misunderstanding of a no good woman 
Yeah, lord they've both caused my heart to bleed 
Yeah 

Every mornin' 
I can hear out of my window 
The blues come winning 
I can hear the blues call my name baby 
Every mornin' 
Every mornin' 
You can hear the willows weep and mown for me 
Lord now, every mornin' you can hear the willows weep and mown for me 
My little girl has left me 
That's what caused my heart to bleed 
That's all that caused my heart to bleed 
Bleeding heart 
Lord that's too bad I have a bleeding heart 
Please come back home to me baby
Well, it's one for the money,
Two for the show,
Three to get ready,
Now go, cat, go

But don't you...
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, you can knock me down,
Step in my face,
Slander my name,
All over the place

Well, do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes
And don't you...
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, you can burn my house,
Steal my car,
Drink my liquor,
From an old fruit jar

Do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh, honey, lay off of my shoes
And don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well, it's one for the money,
Two for the show,
Three to get ready,
Now go, go, go

But don't you
Step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
Anger he smiles, towering in shiny metallic purple armor 
Queen jealousy, envy waits behind him 
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground 
Blue are the life giving waters taking for granted 
They quietly understand. 
Once happy Turquoise armies lay opposite ready 
But wonder why the fight is on 

But they're all bold as love 
they're all bold as love 
they're all bold as love 
Just ask the Axis 

My Red is so confident 
He flashes trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria 
Orange is young, full of daring 
But very unsteady for the first go round 
My Yellow in this case is not so mellow 
In fact I'm trying to say that it's frightened like me 
And all this emotions of mine 
Keep holding me from giving my life to a rainbow like you 

But I'm, yeah, I'm bold as love 
Well, I'm bold, bold as love 
I'm bold as love 
Just ask the Axis, he knows everything
Born under a bad sign.
I've been down since I began to crawl.
If it wasn't for bad luck,
I wouldn't have no luck at all.

Bad luck and trouble's my only friend,
I've been down ever since I was ten.

Born under a bad sign.
I've been down since I began to crawl.
If it wasn't for bad luck,
I wouldn't have no luck at all.

You know, wine and women is all I crave.
A big bad woman's gonna carry me to my grave.

Born under a bad sign.
I've been down since I began to crawl.
If it wasn't for bad luck,
I wouldn't have no luck at all.

Bad luck and trouble's been my only friend,
I've been down ever since I was ten.

Born under a bad sign.
I've been down since I began to crawl.
If it wasn't for bad luck,
I wouldn't have no luck.
If it wasn't for real bad luck,
I wouldn't have no luck at all.

Born under a bad sign.
Born under a bad sign.
The morning is dead and the day is too
There's nothing left here to lead me, but the velvet moon
All my loneliness I have felt today
It's a little more than enough to make a man throw himself away
And I continue to burn the Midnight Lamp, alone

Now the smiling portrait of you
is still hanging on my frowning wall
It really doesn't, it really doesn't bother me too much at all
It's just the eh ever falling dust that makes it so hard for me to see
That forgotten earring laying on the floor
Facing coldly towards the door
And I continue to burn the Midnight Lamp, all alone
Burn!
Yeah, yeah
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Loneliness is such a drag!

So here I sit to face that same old fireplace
Getting ready for the same old explosion
Going through my mind
And soon enough the time will tell
About the circus in the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone who will toll my bell
And I continue to burn the same old lamp, alone
Yeah
Darling, can you hear me calling you?
So lonely
Gotto blow my mind
Yeah, yeah
Lonely, lonely . . .
(Bob Dylan)
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back
I'm sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
That he needs you to test his inventions.

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to.

He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it.

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to.

Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little ten women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning.

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to.
Can you see me begging you on my knees?
Whoa yeah
Can you see me baby?
Baby please don't leave
Yeah if you can see me doing that
You can see in the future of a thousand years

Can you hear me, cryin' all over town?
Yeah babe
Can you hear me baby, cryin' cause you put me down?
What's with ya?
If you can hear me doing that
You can hear a freight train coming from a thousand miles

Ah yeah

Can you hear me, singing this song to you?
Ah you better open up your ears, baby
Can you see me baby, singing this song to you?
Ah shucks
If you can hear me sing
You better come home like you supposed to do

Can you see me?
Hey hey
I don't believe you can see me
Whoa yeah
Can you hear me baby?
I don't believe you can

You can't see me.
Down the street you can hear her scream you're a disgrace
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now he stands outside
And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool

He cries oh, girl you must be mad,
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?
Against the door he leans and starts a scene,
And his tears fall and burn the garden green

And so castles made of sand fall in the sea, eventually

A little Indian brave who before he was ten,
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built up a dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior Indian Cheif

Many moons past and more the dream grew strong until
Tomorrow he would sing his first war song and fight his first battle
But something went wrong, surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

And so castles made of sand melts into the sea, eventually

There was a young girl, who's heart was a frown
Cause she was crippled for life,
And she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop living,
So she decided to die

She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled you wont hurt me no more
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
Look a golden winged ship is passing my way
And it really didn't have to stop, it just kept on going...

And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, eventually
Well I wish I was a catfish,
Swimming in, lord, the deep blue sea.
I'd have a, all you pretty women,
fishin' after me, fishin' after me,
fishin' after me. Yeah.
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah.

When I went down, my girlfriends house.
And I sat down, lord, on her front step.
And she said a, come in now Jimi.
My husband just now left, just now left.
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah.

Well there's two, two trains runnin',
but there's not one, lord, that's goin' my way.
You know there's a one train runnin' at midnight.
Other one leave just for a day,
leave just for a day.
Ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah, ohh yeah

I want to love you so much 'til I hope I don't break it
I want to love you so much 'til I can't stand it
I want to love you so strong 'til you've got to say you've had it
Yeah
Hey!
You don’t love me, you just want me.
So let’s make it baby, so I can leave.
You don’t need me. You just want to bleed me.
So take out your dagger, and cut me free, cut me free.
Cut me free...
Hey.

Hey!
You don’t love me, you just want to suffocate me
So hand me your blankets and take your dirty sheets
Dirty sheets, yeah...
Take your dirty sheets...
Well I must admit that you can be a pretty good artist
But I’ve never seen that smile painted all across your face.
Baby, baby on your
Baby on your face
Baby on your face

Oh I do declare you should be a rocket
You get me spaced out, laid out, look at the sun fade out.
And you almost made me leave my faith outside.

Hey, look at ya, all lovey-dovey when you mess around with that needle.
Well I
I wonder how would your loving be other-wise...
I wonder just how would your loving be, other-wise...
Well dig this brother.
I’m gonna spank your hands and I’m gonna throw away your stupid needle
I’m gonna try to make love straight, for the very first and last time.
Slow it down sugar, unless you in a hurry to die

You don’t love me girl, you just want to hurt me.
So let’s hurry and get this scene over so can marry up with that old sweet.
You don’t need me, you just wanna see me watch you, run after that suicide ball
Bouncin’ across the freeway
Bang, bang! Shoot, shoot
As long as you’re yourself girl, I’ll try not to give a hoot.
Oh, yeah, yes, slow down
Bang, bang! Shoot, shoot.
Slow down, slow down, slow down...
You jump in front of my car when you,
You know all the time that
Ninty miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive
You tell me its alright, you dont mind a little pain
You say you just want me to take you for a ride

Youre just like crosstown traffic
So hard to get through to you
Crosstown traffic
I dont need to run over you
Crosstown traffic
All you do is slow me down
And Im tryin to get on the other side of town

Im not the only soul whos accused of hit and run
Tire tracks all across your back
I can see you had your fun
But darlin cant you see my signals turn from green to red
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead

Youre just like crosstown traffic
So hard to get through to you
Crosstown traffic
I dont need to run over you
Crosstown traffic
All you do is slow me down
And I got better things on the other side of town
As I looked into my crystal ball...
There was formed a tragedy.
Oh but there's nothing to worry about...
It was just a flash from my memory.
Well it seems that the holiday wheel...,
You know, the one that was between earth
And the moon...well any way, there was
2,000,000 killed...bodies floating in the
Afternoon...

Explosions, 1,000 or more, announcing
Tidal waves and hurricanes...
And down on earth we lost 3 continents.
Their fiery soul snuffed out by
Nature's ice and rains...

And pieces of my life...floating,
Still soaring through space...
But my sons and their wives
Landed on mars to start another race...

As I gazed upon my crystal ball,
There formed a cloud of jealousy.
But there's nothing to feel sad about...
By this time, it's due for only history.
Well, it seems that the chambers of the
Gods were being emptied for good.
Why would such heavenly beings want
To desert earth ? 
But as I watched I understood.

As the clouds turned to a jealous
Green, which was concieved in the heart
Of man...the people didn't respect
The help of the gods. instead they turned against
Immortal man. as they tried to defy, they
Died, into the wicked pits of hell.

Diana wept a tear after we made love
And said: "my earthly darling, I must bid
You farewell...the fate of your mud brothers ...
As pieces of my life...floating,
Still soaring in space...
She could have been my wife
But her time, I didn't dare wish
To waste.

As I stared into my crystal ball,
There was formed a tearing of hearts.
Ego armies marched antly onto view
Only to be blown apart.

As the sun whispered it's secret
Through space...to men thinking the false pride
Opposite...telling them that it was
Such a disgrace to think that men were


The ruler of it. well you know
How the story goes...the sun they thought
Was their circling slave...
Round and round and round the
Table she goes. some carried
The thought right to their grave...
And I smell the scorch of the
Burnt out minds...who searched
For the hurting truth of space. and the
Dizziness they felt inside...
Reflected off the spinning
Slave pebble earth...

As fragments of my life...
Some floating, some soaring in space
Collections of my soul
Will turn complete only as time will age.

As my tears drop on my crystal ball,
Magnifies the reflections of christ.
As I blink, his angels take him away.
What he said, man tries to self
?help from god. as reward, he
Wipes our blood from his eyes...
And the cross that he would
Use for his throne represents
Not life but death. is this the way
All heroes go ? ...carrying the first necklace
Of death...
His preaching the belief
Of eternal happiness to rest.
Or were his angels just ufos
Vapor trails lead from
Another light year land...
Or was it really tomorrow's
Awakening day dream...blemished
By the smudgy finger prints of man...

And slivers of my life...floating,
Still soaring in space...
And spirits of bee hives
Even they find a resting place.

As I wander through my crystal ball,
I suddenly ride upon the waves of sound.
I see platforms of launching
Pads even before the first blade of
Grass turned brown.

And I taste their tunnels through
The sky...as the axis turns in it's womb.
Frozen flowers and animals try to
Hold positions they had before
Their morning bloomed...
And I follow the last rocket up
To the libraries of the moon's meadows.
Here comes Dolly Dagger (strong) (it's) 
Her love's so heavy, she's gonna make you stagger 
Dolly Dagger, she drinks her blood from a jagged edge 
Been riding broom stricks since she was 15 
Blowing out all the other witches on the scene 

She got a bull whip just as long as your life 
Her tongue can ever scratch the soul of the devil's wife 
Well I see her in action at the players choise 
Turning all the love men into doughnut boys 

Hey, red hot Momma step aside 
This chik's gonna turn you to a block of ice - look out! 
Look at burned out superman 
Trying to shoot his dust on the sun 
Captain Coconut is dead on the run 
The words of love, do they ever touch Dolly Brown 
Better get some highway and clear out of town 

(She ain't satisfied 'til she gets what she's after 
She drinks her blood from a jagged edge 
You better watch out, baby, here comes your master)
Drifting
On a sea of forgotten teardrops
On a lifeboat
Sailing for
Your love

Sailing home

Drifting
On a sea of old heartbreaks
On a lifeboat
Sailing for
Your love
Sailing home
I see hands and distant faces 
Reaching upward, not quite touching the promised land 
Well I tasted a whole lot of precious years wasted 
Saying please Lord, give us a helping hand 
There's got to be some changes, a whole lotta real changes 
You better hope love is the answer 
You better hope it comes before the summer 
Well everybody can hear the sound of Freedom speeding high 
Sirens flashing with earth and rockets stoning 
You better love me like this gonna be the last time 
And tell the child to bury daddy's old clothes 
Yeah, they're talking about getting together 
Together for love or blood 
You better hope love is the answer 
You better hope it comes before the summer 

Everybody, every sister, every mother 
To feel the light, it's shining bright 
Everybody's gotta live together 
Right on, baby, feel those surf blues coming at you 

Don't let your imagination take you by surprise 
A queen I'll be one day, visualize 
My head in the cloud, my feet on the pavement 
Don't get too stoned, please remember you're a man 
There's got to be some changes 
Get it together, gonna be a lot of re-arranges 
You better be ready, Lord Lord Lord 
Let's hope love comes before the summer 
Everybody 
Together feel the light 
You gotta feel the light, baby 
Everybody 
You gotta live together 
Right on together 
Everybody got to feel that surf blues coming at you

FADE OUT
Yeah, his guitar slung across his back
His dusty boots in his cadillac
Flamin' hair just a blowin' in the wind
Ain't seen a bed in so long it's a sin
He left home when he was seventeen
The rest of the world he had longed to see
But everybody knows the boss
A rolling stone who gathers no moss

But you'd probably call him a tramp
But it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile, yeah

Now some people say he had a girl back home
Who messed around and did him pretty wrong
They tell me it kinda hurt him bad
Kinda made him feel pretty sad
I couldn't say what went through his mind
Anyway, he left the world behind
But everybody knows the same old story,
In love and war you can't lose in glory

Now you'd probably call him a tramp
But I know it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile

Walk on brother, yeah
One more brother

His old guitar slung across his back
His dusty boots in his cadillac
Flamin' hair just a blowin' in the wind
Ain't seen a bed in so long its a sin

Now you may call him a tramp
But I know it goes a little deeper than that
He's a highway chile

Walk on brother
Dont let no one stop you
Highway chile
Yeah yeah yeah
Highway chile
Go on down the highway
Highway chile
Yeah yeah yeah
Highway chile
You got me sitting up on the shelf
While you're out bewitching someone else.
Do I live, do I die
Do I laugh, do I cry
What game am I supposed to loose this time ? 

You got chains attached to my head
You spreading magic honey all in your bed
What is it you want ? 
Just a puppet that talks
Or maybe just a lover who makes love to the dead.

Step onto the stage...just a few more minutes...
Let's see what kind of juggler you really are.
Say without that whip and those bloody boots
Which are rented...you actually could become

A morning star...
But you rang your last bell
Even your planets, they've gone to hell
And your world turns to nothing but a bubble
In a shotgun jar.
And now you don't know who you really are.

So instead of trying to make me your slave
Why don't you just...call it a day.
Either way I'm gonna win
So save yourself some wind
Don't make me to be the last to see
You to your grave...
Well well, ball and chain...for sale.
New day come...masters gone to hell...
Well well, ball and chain...for sale.
Sunrise come...master's dying in hell...
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey

Look at the sky turn a hell fire red
Somebody's house is burnin' down down, down down
Down, down, down.

Well I asked my friend where is that black smoke comin' from ?
He just coughed and changed the subject and said oh wa I think it might
Snow some
So I left him sippin' his tea an' I jumped in my chariot
And rode off to see just why and who could it be this time.

Sisters and brothers daddys mothers standin' 'round cryin'
When I reached the scene the flames were makin' a ghostly whine
So I stood on my horse's back an' I screamed without a crack
I say oh baby why'd you burn your brother's house down ?

Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey !

Look out the sky turn a hell fire red Lord
Somebody's house is burnin' down down, down down
Look out the sky turn a hell fire red Lord
Somebody's house is burnin' down down, down down down.

Well someone stepped from the crowd he was nineteen miles high
He shouts retired and disgusted so we paint red through the sky
I said the truth is straight ahead so don't burn yourself instead
Try to learn instead of burn, hear what I say, yeah, yeah.

So I fin'ly rode away but I'll never forget that day
'Cause when I reached the valley I looked way down cross the way
A giant boat from space landed with eerie grace
And came and taken all the dead away.

Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey !

What'd I say.
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red Lord
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red Lord
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down
Look at the sky, look at the sky.

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby.
Will I live tomorrow? 
Well, I just can't say 
Will I live tomorrow? 
Well, I just can't say 
But I know for sure 
I don't live today 

No sun comin' through my windows 
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave 
No-ho sun comin' through my windows 
Feel like I'm livin' at the bottom of a grave 
I wish you'd hurry up and execute me 
so I can be on my miserable way 

(Well), I don't 
live today 
Maybe tomorrow, I just can't say, but, uh 
I don't 
live today 
Its such a shame to waste your time away like this 

Existing 

Well, uh-I don't 
live today 
Maybe tomorrow, I just can't tell you baby, but, uh 
Oh, I don't 
live today 
Its such a shame to spend the time 
away like this 
existing 

Yeah 
Ow 
Yeah 
Oh, no 
Yeah 

Oh, there ain't no life no where 

uh-ha, {cough}-hmm, {sniff}

Get experienced {clap} 
Get experienced 
Uh, get experienced {clap} 
Uh, get experienced {clap} (BV=[Are] you experienced?) 
Are you experienced? (BV={clap} Are you experienced?)
If the sun refuse to shine 
I don't mind 
I don't mind 
If the mountains fell in the sea 
Let it be 
It ain't me 
Got my own world to look thru 
And I ain't gonna copy you 

Now if 6 turned out to be 9 
I don't mind 
I don't mind 
If all the hippies cut off all their hair 
I don't care 
I don't care 
Dig it 
Got my own world to look thru 
And I ain't gonna copy you 

White collared conservative flashing down the street 
Pointing their plastic fingers at me 
They're hoping soon my kind will drop and die 
But I'm gonna wave my freak flag high, high 

Fall mountain, just don't fall on me 
Hello, Mr. Businessman, why you ain't dressed like me? 

I'm the one who has to die when it's time for me to die 
So let me live my life the way I want to 
Sing on, brother, 
Play on, drummer
Well I, I just came back today, I just came back from the storm 
Said, I just came back, baby, I just came back from the storm 
Well I did not know it then, but I was suffering, suffering 
For my love to keep me warm 
It was so cold and lonely, the wind was crying 
And the rain was tearing me up 
I was so cold and lonely 
The crying blue rain was tearing me up 
I want to thank you, my sweet darling... 
For digging in the mud and picking me up

Deep down Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar just like a ringing a bell

Go go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineerswould see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play

Go go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Johnny B. Goode

His mother told him "Someday you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big old band.
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight."

Go go
Go Johnny go
Go go go Johnny go
Go go go Johnny go
Go go go Johnny go
Go

Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didnt you
Peopled called you, said beware the doll, youre bound to fall,
You thought they were all kidding you
You used to laugh about
Everybody else that was hanging out
Now you dont talk so loud
Now you dont seem so proud
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
In no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

Well she was walking thru the clouds 
With a circus mind that's running wild 
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams and fairy tales 
(that's all she ever thinks about) 
Riding with the wind 

When I'm sad she comes to me 
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free 
It's alright, she says, it's alright 
Take anything you want from me, anything 
Fly on, Little Wing

With a thousand smiles, she gives to me free 
It's alright she says it's alright

What fun we had
Chasin' rabbits
In the sand
Hey hey hey
Hey!
May I whisper in your ear
From my heart so you'll clearly hear...
There are people so dear...
They're like children...
Naked in a cold world...
Beautiful children
In an old world...

May I take you away
From the evils of today
To the dreams of tomorrow.
You know that heaven...
Has no sorrow.
You know that heaven...
Has no tomorrow.

Hear the sound of the magic drums...
Hearts are beating for the sun...
Sending evil on the run...
Now watch the wind...

Look over yonder...
Here comes some news...
Coming down like lightning...
Straight for me and you.
People of destruction
Your time is out of date...
People who's living crooked,
Better start getting straight.

I've been through some changes,
A whole lot of re-arranges...
Been through some ups and downs,
And whole lot of turn arounds.
I been on the shelf and even killed myself...


1,000 times ago and maybe 1,000
Times more.

She said she comes from ice land...
I told her I was from the west.
She took me to the snow capped mountains...
And then she put me through the test...
We walked across the glacier,
The horses stayed behind...
And as we laid between the
Frozen vallies we kissed
For the very first time.
And now we're stuck together.

It was too long ago.
But it seems like...years ago...
Since I felt the warm hello of the sun.
Lately things seem a little colder...
The wind, it seems to get a little bolder.

Forget of my name
Remember it only as a hand shake,
Introduction to my belief which is god.
Ride instead the waves of my interpreture,
Music, sound
Hynotic if you choose
But truth and life
Regardless of your questionable timid compromises
Which I intend to erase.
Which I will erase without hint of reward
As I am only a messenger
And you a sheep in process of evolution
Almost at death with yourself
And on the staircase of birth.
Soon you may almost forget the smell of your family...
Waterfall 
nothing can harm me at all 
My worries seem so very small 
with my waterfall 

I can see 
my rainbow calling me 
through the misty breeze 
of my waterfall 

Some people say 
day-dreamings for all the, huh, 
lazy minded fools 
with nothin' else to do 
So let them laugh, laugh at me 
So just as long as I have you 
to see me through 
I have nothing to lose 
'Long as I have you 

Waterfall 
don't ever change your ways 
Fall with me for a million days 
Oh, my waterfall
Well, I travel at a speed,
Of a reborn man.
I got a lot of love to give,
From the mirrors of my hand.
I said a message of love,
Don't you run away.
Look at your heart,
Come along with me today.

Well I am what I am thank you.
Some people just don't understand.
Find yourself first,
And then your tool.
Find yourself first,
Don't you be no fool.

Here comes a woman,
Wrapped up in chains.
Messin' with that fool babe,
Your life is pain.
If you want to be free,
Come along with me.
Don't mess with the man,
He'll never understand.
I said find yourself first,
And then your talent.
Work hard in your mind,
So if you come alive,
You better prove to the man,
You're as strong as him.

Everybody come alive,
Everybody love alive.
Everybody love alive,
Everybody hear my message.
Flames!
I see electric flames yall
They are burning all over
All over me.
Voodoo, Voodoo
That’s what they call it now
And ya best better
Gone and let it be
But I’ve always been a gambling man
So you know I’m gonna, gonna, gonna take a chance
This why cause,
Can’t love electric flames
Though it can fuck with me
Cause I’m, I’m a Mojo Man

Near a Fiji land
With a one eyed toad, just walking, in the palm of my hand
Devils, troubles, witches prove
Every girl to me
And old black cats, were my company
So you know I wasn’t alone

Neptune champion games to an aqua
world is so very dear.
"Right this way," smiles a mermaid,
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer.

I can hear Atlantis full of cheer...
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer...
Oh Mr. pit
Oh Mr. pit
Mr. pitiful
Who let you down?
Who let you down?
Who let you down?

You still don't believe
You don't believe
You don't believe
That greed's for a show
Your soap box unfolds

But, please come down from that cloud
You see at all I don't expect you to admit that you were wrong
Just wanna know how you've been
Don't make me feel bad that we're still friends
Started it all over in my bed

I hope that you see through your picket
I hope that you see through your big yard and white picket fence
To make amends, to still be friends, to still be my friend

So where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
While I was out
While I was out
While I was out

Well I don't believe
I don't believe

Everything was seen
And if you don't like the movie then quit at me

But, please come down from that cloud
You see at all I don't expect you to admit that you were wrong
Just wanna know how you've been
Don?t make me feel bad that we're still friends
Started it all over in my bed

I hope that you see through your picket
I hope that you see through your big yard and white picket fence
To make amends, still be friends, still be friends, to still be my friend, still be my friend, still be my friend
Hey, look out for my glass up there, man!
That's my drink, man, that's my drink, alright...
Make it a double, or eh...
Somebody has to sing
Some body will sing?
Somebody will sing, right?
(I don't know!)

Y'all pass me that bottle,
And I'll sing you all a real song
Yeah!
Let me get my key, ahum!

Well, I'm looking through Harlem
My stomach squeal just a little more
A stagecoach full of feathers and footprints,
Pulls up to soap box door
Now a lady with a pearl handled necktie
Tied to the driver's fence
Breathes in my face,
Bourbon and coke possessed words
& "Haven't I seen you somewhere in hell,
Or was it just an accident?"
(You know how I felt then, and so:)

Before I could ask "was it the East or West side?"
My feet they howled in pain
The wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep,
But not as deep in my mind as the rain
And as they pulled away I could see her words
Stagger and fall on my muddy tent
Well I picked them up, brushed them off,
To see what they say,
And you wouldn't believe:
`Come around to my room, with the tooth in the middle,
And bring along the bottle and a president'

And eh sometimes it's not so easy, baby
Especially when your only friend,
Talks, sees, looks and feels like you,
And you do just the same as him
(Gets very lonely up this road, baby)
(Yeah, hmmm, yeah)
(Got more to say!)

Well I'm riding through LA (huh),
On a bicycle built for fools
And I seen one of my old buddies
And he say, "you don't look the way you usually do"
I say, "well, some people look like a coin-box"
He say, "look like you ain't got no coins to spare"
And I laid back and I thought to myself, and I said this:
I just picked up my pride from underneath the pay phone,
And combed this breath right out of my hair
And sometimes it's not so easy
Especially when your only friend
Talk, sees, looks and feels like you,
And you do just the same as him

Just got out of a Scandinavian jail,
And I'm on my way straight home to you
But I feel so dizzy I take a quick look in the mirror,
To make sure my friend's here with me too
And you know good well I don't drink coffee,
So you fill my cup full of sand
And the frozen tea leaves on the bottom
Sharing lipstick around the broken edge
And my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on
And your cat he attacked me from his pill-box ledge
And I thought you were my friend too
Man, my shadow comes in line before you
I'm finding out that it's eh not so easy
Specially when your only friend
Talks, looks, sees and feels like you,
And you do the same just like him

(Lord it's so lonely here, hmmm, yeah)
Yeah!
(Pass me that bottle over there...)
Yeah, yeah, okay...

She's just a nigh bird flyin' throught the night 
Fly on 
She's just a night bird making a midnight, midnight flight 
Sail on, sail on 
Well, she's flyin' down to me 
But, 'til tomorrow got to set her free 
Set her free 

So all we got, baby, is one precious night 
All we got is one precious night 
Throw your blues and shoes and things 
And lay it down under the bed 
Just wrap me up in your beautiful wings, 
Better hear what I say, yeah 
Oh, carry me home 
Please take me through your dreams 
Inside your world I want to be 

Until tomorrow no tears will be shed 
Hold on 'til the sun gets out of bed 
Hold on, hold on, baby 
Fly on

Lord, I had a woman
Lord knows she was good to me in every way
Yes, I had a woman
A real woman
Lord, she gave me lovin' both night and day
My sun shine
Woo hoo
For my woman
Or else or else
Its going to take me one more day
If it takes me
She went way down in Dallas
Way down in Texas land
Lord she had me wrapped around her wrist and around her finger baby
Like a ring wrapped around a finger of a severed hand
I'm lookin' for my Dallas honey bee
Who can you be
Who can you be
Ooh hoo hoo help me
Help me look for her
Oh yeah
Golden rose, the color of the dream I had
Not too long ago
A misty blue and the lillac too
A never to grow old.

A there you were under the tree of song
Sleeping so peacefully
In your hand a flower played
A waiting there for me.

I have never
Laid eyes on you
Not before
This timeless day
But you woke and whoa
Smiled my name
And you stole
My heart away
A stole my heart away little girl, yeah

Misty blue and lillac too
Gold and rose, gold are rose, gold and rose.

It's only a dream
I'd love to tell somebody about this dream
The sky was filled with a thousand stars
While the sun kissed the mountains blue
And eleven moons played across rainbows
Above me and you.
Gold and rose the color of the velvet walls surround us.
Shoot down some of those airplanes your flyin'
Especially the ones that are flyin' too low
Shoot down some of those airplanes
Especially the ones that your flyin' too low

Come on back to earth my friend
Come on back up with me
We've all been up through the night time baby
Now let's read the rays of the reality

With the power of soul
Anything is possible

Flyin' too much today
It's so groovy to float around sometimes
Even a jelly fish will tell you that
I said flotation is groovy
And he said
And a jelly fish will agree to that

Yeah, but that old jelly fish
Been floatin' around so long
Lord he ain't got a bone in his jelly back
Floatin' every day and every night
Ridin' high is a risk
Sometimes the wind ain't right

Anything is possible

Hello, my friend

All by myself 
Just couldn't make it.

What the winds blowing down 
Have you heard Baby 
A lot of peoples coming right on down. 
Communication coming on strong

if your hair is short or long 
I said get out of your grave 
Everybody is dancing in the street 
Do what you know don't be slow 
You gotta practice what you preach 
Cause it's time for you and me. 
Forget about the past Baby 
Things ain't what they use to be 
Keep on Straight Ahead 
We got to stand side by side 
We got to stand together and organize 
They say power to the people 
Thats what they're screamin' 
Freedom of the soul 
Pass it on, pass it on to the young and old. 
You got to tell me the children the truth 
they don't need a whole lot of lies 
Cause one of these days Baby 
They'll be running things. 
So when you give them love 
You better give it right 
Woman - Child - Man and Wife 
the best love to have is the Love of Life. 
Hello my friend 
So good to see you again 
Been all by myself 
I don't think I can make it alone 
Keep pushing ahead.
I used to live in a room full of mirrors
All I could see was me
Well I take my spirit and I smash my mirrors
Now the whole world is here for me to see
I said the whole world is here for me to see
Now I'm searchin' for my love to be
Hey!!

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!!!

Broken glass was all in my brain
Cuttin' screamin' crying in my head
Broken glass was all in my brain
They fall in my dreams cut me in my bed
Makin' love was strange in my bed
I said a makin' love was strange in my bed
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!!!

All right
Ooo ooo
Yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
No place stumpin'
No place far
Can't find the floor
No where at all
See nothing but sunshine
All around

Love comes shinin' over the mountains
Love comes shinin' over the sea
Love won't shine on my baby
Then I'll know who's exactly for me
Lord, I'll know who'll be for me
In the meen time, which is a groovy time
She walks with a bell-clock round her neck
So the hippies think she's in with time
Time...
Her hair glistens like robins on a deck
Branches attack me from her neck
She's so fine
She's so very very fine
The sun from a cloud sinks into her eyes
The rain from a tree soaks into her mind
Mind...
Morning sign sounds just like a lark
All these signs are always a start
She's so fine
She's so very very fine
When I veer I get so near
But so far far far away
Listen to me today
We united just beside a leaf
The ground was hard underneath her her
Ahhhahhh
She's so fine
Ahhhahhh
It's very far away, it takes about half a day to get there 
If we travel by my dragonfly 
No, it's not in Spain, but all the same 
You know it's a groovy name 
And the wind's just right 

Hang on, my darling 
Hang on, if you want to go 
You know it's a really groovy place 
And it's just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic 

The clouds are really low and they overflow 
With cotton candy and battle grounds red and brown 
But it's all in your mind 
Don't think your time on bad things 
Just float your little mind around - look out 

Hang on, my darling, yeah 
Hang on, if you want to go 
It puts everything else on the shelf 
With just a little bit of Spanish Castle Magic 
With just a little bit of daydream here and there
Oh, say can you see 
By the dawns early light 
What so poudly we hail'd 
At the twilights last gleaming? 
Who's broad striped and bright stars 
Through the parilous fight 
O'er the ramparts we watched 
Were so gallantly streaming? 
And the rocket's red glare! 
The bombs bursting in air! 
Gave proof through the night 
That our flag was still there. 
Oh, say does that star spangled banner yet wave 
O'er the land of the free 
And the home of the brave?
Rainy day, rain all day
Aint no use in gettin uptight
Just let it groove its own way
Let it drain your worries away yeah
Lay back and groove on a rainy day hey
Lay back and dream on a rainy day
Lay back and groove on a rainy day
Lay back
Oh yeah !

After all the jacks are in their boxes 
and the clowns have all gone to bed 
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street 
footsteps dressed in red 
And the wind whispers Mary 

A broom is drearily sweeping 
up the broken pieces of yesterdays life 
Somewhere a queen is weeping 
Somewhere a king has no wife 
And the wind, it cries Mary 

The traffic lights, they turn, uh, blue tomorrow 
and shine their emptiness down on my bed 
The tiny island sags down stream 
'cause the life that lived is, 
is dead 
And the wind screams Mary 

Uh-will the wind ever remember 
the names it has blow in the past? 
And with this crutch, its old age, and its wisdom 
it whispers no, this will be the last 
And the wind cries Mary
{intro slowwed down talking begins} 
Star fleet to scout ship, please give your position. Over. 
I'm in orbit around the third planet from the star called 
the sun. Over. 
You mean its the Earth? Over. 
Positive. It is known to have some form of intelligent species. Over. 
I think we should take a look. 
{intro slowwed down talking ends} 

Strange beautiful grass of green, 
with your majestic silver seas 
Your mysterious mountains I wish to see closer 
May I land my kinky machine? 

{start slowwed down} 
Strange beautiful, grass of green 
with your majestic silver seas 
Your mysterious mountains I wish to see closer 
May I land my kinky machine? 
{end slowwed down} 

Although your world wonders me, 
with your majestic and superior cackling hen 
Your people I do not understand, 
so to you I shall put an end 
And you'll 
never hear 
surf music again 

{start slowwed down...rough guess at lyrics} 
Secret 
Oh, secret 
Oh 
Shhhh... 
{end slowwed down}
"Ha Ha Ha", says Mama Bear as she irons Daddy's holey underwear
and "Hee Hee Hee", says Daddy bear as Junior pours honey all on sister hair.
Anyway you know they live happily ever after.

Well, "Ho ho ho" say the little fish 
as the sad fisherman goes home without a hitch
But "Hee hee hee" says the fisherman 
with his lady burning french fries in the frying pan
(This is so silly man)

"Hee hee hee" says you to me 
(Man I don't feel like going through with this, this is really silly)
Oh man, I wanna die 
'cause walking around on the ground is really cramping my high
I sure don't wanna live without you forever after, no.

Now what does all this have to do with the three little bears?
Well, I was just feeling blue, 'cause I really care
That you're still gone from me and I'm as sad as I can be
So I'll sing and play this tune until you come back home to me.
Turn off your mind relax and float down stream
It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void,
It is shining, it is shining.

Yet you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

And ignorance and hate mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not leaving, it is not leaving

So play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
I am your trash man-
Throw out all your trash today-
Clean out your mind today-
Please pass the weed
And please take some heed.
Take your fast glass guns and
Throw them away.
There he goes, hey

Gypsy talk-
She has been here 3 times and
The 4th time, she was emptied in from
The mouth of a bottle.
Seems like I seen you somewhere before-
And her dog named pig had a red
Neck shaped just like a cracker
Dipped in rot hole.

Address 3rd trash can from the
Left. that's where I'll be-
Just take all your blues
And throw them at my feet.

Yes I sing the blues for me and you.
Let me do changes and come back
And tell you. so it won't be so hard
When it's time for you to go through.

Anything is possible after an
Embarrassing situation-

And once you take but all that
Rubbish and hate and-
Load it on my truck.
But don't make me work late-
I am your trashman-
And don't forget I also want


To live- not just survive-
I ain't your black slave- just
Because I just might try to
Wash out your mind- it's up to
Your friend-
To get up off your rusty behind.

And please pass me the peace weed,
And take some heed-
Throw all that mixed up speed
Away- all that dirt is gonna clog and
Hurt- man you reach 100 years old in a day-
I am your trashman-
I am your trashman-
I come to keep your houses clean.

Take out all your dirty blues and
Dreams-

Collect for the bill,
That's when I come around for
My pleasure kill...

Your t.v.

All your hang ups or
Come downs, I'm gonna kill...

I just want to talk to you, I won't do you no harm 
I just want to know about your different lives on this here people 
farm 
I heard some of you got your families 
Living in cages tall and cold 
And some just stay there and dust away 
Past the age of old 
Is this true? 
Please let me talk to you. 

I just want to know about the rooms behind your minds 
Do I see a vacuum there or am I going blind? 
Or is it just remains from vibrations and echoes long ago 
Things like 'Love the World' and 'Let your fancy flow' 
Is this true? 
Please let me talk to you, 
let me talk to you. 

I have lived here before the days of ice 
And of course this is why I'm so concerned 
And I come back to find the stars misplaced 
And the smell of a world that has burned 
The smell of a world that has burned 

Well maybe maybe, it's just a change of climate 
I can dig it, I can dig it, baby, I just want to see 
So where do I purchase my ticket 
I would just like to have a ring side seat 
I want to know about the new Mother Earth 
I want to hear and see everything
1.

I feel the ocean swaying me ...
washing away all my pains.
See where I was wounded,
Remember the scar ?
Now you can't see a thing ...
And I feel no pain --

Singing about the Valley of Sunsets
Green and blue ... Canyons too
Singing about Atlantis love songs.
The Valleys of Neptune is arising.

2.

Mercury liquid ... Emerald's shining
Telling me where I came from --
Honey Sun ... Pourquise Bed he
lays in -- ... on the Burning
edge Horizon.

I'm sailing on the Bluebird's mission ...
Bubble and curls and tiptoes in the foam --
See the wind make love to all
the ocean ... Joy spread and
the massage got home --
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets ...
Purple and gold ... the Armies of the Lord
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips ...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising --

3.

Look out East coast, but you're
gonna have a neighbor,
A rebirth land ...
the praying Burning Sands.

We know there were worlds
so much older ...
And they shall rise, and
tell us much more the truth of man --

4.

I see visions of sleeping peaks
erupting ...
releasing all hell that
will shake the Earth from end to end --
And this ain't bad news, good news,
or any news ... it's just the truth,
Better save your souls while
you can --

Singing about the New Valleys
of the Sunrise ... Rainbow clean,
the world is gonna be ...
Singing about getting ready for the new tide ...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising.

And I chop it down with the edge of my hand

500,000 halos ...
Outshined the mud and history.
We washed and drank in
God's tears of joy,
And for once...and for everyone...
The truth was not a mystery--

Love called to all...music is magic.
As we passed over and beyond the walls of nay.
Hand in hand as we lived and


Made real the dreams of peaceful men--

We came together...danced with
The pearls of rainy weather
Riding the waves of music and
Space--music is magic...
Magic is life...
Love as never loved before...
Harmony to son and daughter...man and wife.
You got me floatin' round and round,
Always up, you never let me down
The amazing thing, you turn me on naturally,
And I kiss you when I please.

You got me floatin' round and round,
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please

You got me floatin' across and through
You make me float right on up to you
There's only one thing I need to really get me there,
Is to hear you laugh without a care.

You got me floatin' round and round,
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please

You got me floatin' round and round,
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please

Now your Daddy's cool, and your Mamma's no fool,
They both know I'm heads over heels for you,
And when the day melts down into a sleepy red glow,
That's when my desires start to show.

You got me floatin' round and round,
You got me floatin' never down
You got me floatin' naturally
You got me floatin' float to please.
