0,Achilles Last Stand ,"It was an April morning when they told us we should go 
As I turn to you, you smiled at me 
How could we say no? 

With all the fun to have, to live the dreams we always had 
Oh, the songs to sing, when we at last return again 

Sending off a glancing kiss, to those who claim they know 
Below the streets that steam and hiss, 
The devil's in his hole 

Oh to sail away, To sandy lands and other days 
Oh to touch the dream, Hides inside and never seen. 

Into the sun the south the north, at last the birds have flown 
The shackles of commitment fell, In pieces on the ground 

Oh to ride the wind, To tread the air above the din 
Oh to laugh aloud, Dancing as we fought the crowd 

To seek the man whose pointing hand, The giant step unfolds 
With guidance from the curving path, That churns up into stone 

If one bell should ring, in celebration for a king 
So fast the heart should beat, As proud the head with heavy feet. 

Days went by when you and I, bathed in eternal summers glow 
As far away and distant, Our mutual child did grow 

Oh the sweet refrain, Soothes the soul and calms the pain 
Oh Albion remains, sleeping now to rise again 

Wandering & wandering, What place to rest the search 
The mighty arms of Atlas, Hold the heavens from the earth 

The mighty arms of Atlas, Hold the heavens from the earth 
From the earth... 

I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way (X2) 

Oh the mighty arms of Atlas, Hold the heavens from the earth."
1,All My Love ,"Should I fall out of love my fire in the night,
To chase a feather in the wind.
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight,
There moves a thread that has no end.

For many hours and days that pass ever soon,
The tides have caused the flame to dim.
At last the arm is straight the hand to the loom,
Is this to end or just begin?

All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love,
To you now.
All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love,
To you now.

The cup is raised the toast is made yet again.
One voice is clear above the din.
Proud Arianne one word my will to sustain,
For me the cloth once more to spin.

All of my love,
All of my love,
All my love,
To you now.
All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love,
To you now.

Yours is the cloth mine is the hand that sews time.
His is the force that lies within.
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find,
He is a feather in the wind.

All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love,
To you now.
All of my love,
Oh, yes.
All of my love,
To you now.
All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love, love.
Sometime,
Sometime,
Sometime,
Sometime.
It's all, all, all, all,
All of  my love,
All of my love,
All of my love,
To you now.
All of my love,
All of my love,
All of my love,
To, to you, and you, an you, and yeah.
I get a little bit lonely
Just a little bit,
Just a little bit.
Just a little bit lonely
Just a little bit lonely"
2,Around And Around ,"I say the joint was rockin'
A goin' 'round and round
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down

Twelve o'clock
Well the place as packed
Front doors was locked
Well the place was packed
When the police knocked
Both doors flew back
But they kept on rocking

Rockin' Going 'Round and around
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound
A well they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down

Oh it sounds so sweet I gotta take me a chance
Rose out of my seat I just had to dance
Started movin' my feet well a clappin' my hands
Well the joint started

Rockin' Going 'Round and around
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound
A well they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down

Twelve o'clock

Rockin' till the moon went down

3,As Long as I Have You ,"I was born in darkness
I fought my way out to the blue - yeah!
Had to learn to stand up
Even when they scared me, out of, out of my shoes.

Let me tell you girl that you ain't a-never 
Seen nothin' yet
There ain't a thing in this world that I can't never get
Lord, you know, yeah
Lord, yeah
Give me a thunder upon you
And I turn it to stone
Let me put this world in the palm of your hand
Say you love me,
And I know that half the battle is won

Don't you worry 'bout nothin'
I said I love you babe.
Let me tell you girl
You ain't seen nothin' yet
There's not a thing in this world
I can never get
As long as I have your... love

Yeah, ma ma ma 
Don't it make you feel soo... fair, oh

I feel a little bit lonely, baby
But I never get a little lonely, baby
I said I'm gonna love you
Yeah, I'm a gonna think about
My darlin', darlin', darlin'
How I love you, oh

Every day I work so hard
I bring home my pay, 
But you want more
And people tell me baby, oh (...)

Na na na na na na na na,
Na na na na na na na na...


Born in darkness,
I fought my way back to the blue
I got a lot of sadness
People, when they scared me
Out of my shoes, yeah
Ah, let me tell you girl
That you ain't seen nothing yet
I can't find a thing in the world
That I can never, never, never...
I love, love you
I want my babe
I want my babe

Why don't you...
Why don't you hush, pretty baby, yeah
Every thing is gonna be fine
As long as I have, ah - you..."

5,"Baby, Come On Home ","There was a time, I used to call you on my very own 
We were so happy woman, Talkin' for hours and hours on the telephone

Who's gonna feel all of my... cares 

So I met a sweet little girl, Just about as nice as she could be, oh

and did the same thing again to me...

'Cause I keep thinkin about all the good times 
Keep thinkin' about it, I wanna make you mine

All I ask for when I pray,
steady rollin' woman gonna come my way.
Need a woman gonna hold my hand,
won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man.

Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine. 

Ah all the good times we had, I sang love songs so glad 
Always smiling, never sad, so fine. 

Chorus
As we walk down the country lanes, I'll be singing a song, 
Hear me calling your name. 
Hear the wind within the trees, Telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me. 

Well if the sun shines so bright, Or on our way it's darkest night 
The road we choose is always right, so fine. 

Ah can your love be so strong When so many loves go wrong 
Will our love go on and on... 

* Chorus 

My, my la de la come on now it ain't too far,

So of one thing I am sure, It's a friendship so pure, 
Angels singing all around my door, so fine. 
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do Spend my natural life with you, 
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine.

Hear me call your name."

Ah, who cares, c'mon everybody

Well my baby's number one 
But I'm gonna dance with three or four

Ooh, when you hear that music you can't sit still
If your brother won't rock you then your sister will
Ah, c'mon everybody, whoa yeah

Well, we're gonna have a party 
But we better put a guard outside
If the folks come home I'm afraid 
They're gonna have my hide

16,Carouselambra ,"Sisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace, 
Await their place within the ring of calm; 
Still stand to turn in seconds of release, 
Await the call they know may never come. 
In times of lightness, no intruder dared upon 
To jeopardize the course, upset the run; 
And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun 
As love in the halls of plenty overrun. 

Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast, 
Unending dances shadowed on the day. 
Within their walls, their daunting formless keep, 
Preserved their joy and kept their doubts at bay. 
Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep, 
Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray; 
And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed, 
But no one seemed to question in anyway. 

How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land 
To seek the unsuspecting and the weak; 
And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand 
Toward the foe that threatened from the deep. 
Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand 
Adrift upon a sea of futile speech? 
And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan' 
Where was your word, where did you go? 
Where was your helping, where was your bow? Bow. 
Dull is the armour, cold is the day. 
Hard was the journey, dark was the way. Way. 
I heard the word; I couldn't stay. Oh. 
I couldn't stand it another day, another day, 
Another day, another day. 

Touched by the timely coming, 
Roused from the keeper's sleep, 
Release the grip, throw down the key. 

Held now within the knowing, 
Rest now within the peace. 
Take of the fruit, but guard the seed. 

They had to stay! 

Held now within the knowing, 
Rest now within the beat. 
Take of the fruit, but guard the seed..."
17,Celebration Day ,"Her face is cracked from smiling, all the fears that she's been hiding, 
And it seems pretty soon everybody's gonna know. 
And her voice is sore from shouting, cheering winners who are losing, 
And she worries if their days are few and soon they'll have to go. 

*My, my, my, I'm so happy, I'm gonna join the band, 
We are gonna dance and sing in celebration, We are in the promised land. 

She hears them talk of new ways to protect the home she lives in, 
Then she wonders what it's all about when they break down the door. 

Her name is Brown or White or Black, you know her very well, 
You hear her cries of mercy as the winners toll the bell. 

* Chorus 
There is a train that leaves the station heading for your destination, 
But the price you pay to nowhere has increased a dollar more. 
Yes, it has! 
And if you walk you're gonna get there though it takes a little longer, 
And when you see it in the distance you will wring your hands and moan."
18,Communication Breakdown ,"Hey, girl, stop what you're doin'!
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin.
I don't know what it is that I like about you, but I like it a lot.
Won't let me hold you, Let me feel your lovin' charms.

Chorus:
Communication Breakdown, It's always the same,
I'm having a nervous breakdown, Drive me insane!

Hey, girl, I got something I think you ought to know.
Hey, babe, I wanna tell you that I love you so.
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah!
I'm never gonna let you go,'Cause I like your charms."
19,Custard Pie ,"Drop down, baby, let your daddy see. 
Drop down, mama, just dream of me 
Well, my mama allow me to fool around all night long

See me comin', throw your man out the door 
Ain't no stranger, been this way before 
See me comin', mama, throw your man out the door 
I ain't no stranger, I been this way before. 

Put on your night shirt and your morning gown

21,Dancing Days ,"Dancing days are here again,
As the summer evenings grow.
I got my flower, I got my power,
I got a woman who knows.

I said it's alright,
You know it's alright,
I guess it's all in my heart.
You'll be my only,
My one and only,
Is that the way it should start?

Crazy ways are evident,
By the way you wearin' your clothes.
Sippin' booze is precedent,
As the evening starts to glow.

You know it's alright,
I said it's alright,
You know it's all in my heart.
You'll be my only,
My one and only,
Is that the way it should start?

Do Ya?

You told your mother I'd get you home,
But you didn't say that I got no car.
I saw a lion, he was standin' alone,
With a tadpole in a jar.

You know it's alright,
I said it's alright,
I guess it's all in my heart, heart, heart.
You'll be my only,
My one and only,
Is that the way it should start?

So dancing days are here again,
As the summer evenings grow.
You are my flower, you are my power,
You are my woman who knows.

I said it's alright,
You know it's alright,
You know it's all in my heart.
You'll be my only, yes

23,Dazed and Confused ,"Been Dazed and Confused for so long it's not true.
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you.
Lots of people talk and few of them know,
soul of a woman was created below.

You hurt and abuse tellin' all of your lies.
Run around sweet baby, Lord how they hypnotize.
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been.
Gonna love you baby, here I come again.

Every day I work so hard, bringin' home my hard earned pay
Try to love you baby, but you push me away.
Don't know where you're goin', only know just where you've been,
Sweet little baby, I want you again.

Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true.
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you.
Take it easy baby, let them say what they will.
Will your tongue wag so much when I send you the bill?"
24,Down By The Seaside ,"Down by the seaside. See the boats go sailin' 
Can the people hear, What the little fish are sayin' 

Oh, oh, the people turned away. Oh, the people turned away 

Down in the city streets, see all the folk go racin', racin' 
No time left, to pass the time of day 

The people turned away. The people turned away 
So far away, so far away 

See how they run, see how they run, see how they run, see how they run. 

Do you still do the twist 
Do you find you remember things that well 
I wanna tell you... Some go twistin' every day 
though sometimes it's awful hard to tell 

Out in the country, hear the people singin' 
Singin' 'bout their progress, knowin' where they're goin' 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, the people turned away 
Yes, the people turned away 

Sing loud for the sunshine, pray hard for the rain 
And show your love for Lady Nature. And she will come back again The people turned away 
The people turned away"
25,Dream On ,"Every time that I look in the mirror
All these lines in my face gettin' clearer
The past is gone;
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay

I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin;
You got to lose to know how to win.

Half my life's in books' written pages,
Live and learn from fools and from sages
You know it's true,
All the feelings
Come back to you.

Sing with me,
Sing for the year,
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear.
Sing it with me
If it's just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away.

27,Fixin' To Die ,"Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying
But I hate to leave my children crying
Well, I look over yonder to that burying ground
Look over yonder to that burying ground
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down

Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,

Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying but
I hate to leave my children crying
There's a black smoke rising, Lord
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.

I'm walking kind of funny, Lord

Fixing to die, fixing to die

28,Fool In The Rain ,"Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shining 
Like a star that can't wait for the night 
I hate to think I've been blinded baby 
Why can't I see you tonight? 

And the warmth of your smile starts a-burnin' 
And the thrill of your touch gives me fright 
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning 
Why don't you show up, make it all right? 
Yeah, it's all right. 

And if you promised you'd love so completely 
and you said you would always be true 
You swore that you would never leave me, baby: 
What ever happened to you? 

And you thought it was only in movies 
As you wish all your dreams would come true 
It ain't the first time believe me, baby 
I'm standin here feeling blue 
Yeah I'm blue 

Now I will stand in the rain on the corner 
I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown 
Another ten minutes no longer 
And then I'm turning around 

The clock on the wall's moving slower 
My heart it sinks to the ground 
And the storm that I thought would blow over 
Clouds the light of the love that I found 

Now my body is starting to quiver 
And the palms of my hands getting wet 
I've got no reason to doubt you baby, 
It's all a terrible mess 

I'll run in the rain till I'm breathless 
When I'm breathless I'll run till I drop, hey 
The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless 
I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh yeah 
Light of the love that I found..."
29,For Your Life ,"You said I was the only, With my lemon in your hand 
Exhibition is your habit, Emotion second hand. 
Had to pull away to save me, Maybe next time around 
And she said, 'don't you want it? 
Don't you want coca-coco-cocaine?
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to try it, fry it, na na na yeah.

Heard a cry for mercy, In the city of the damned 
Oh oh babe, damned. Down in the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground.  Oh, hello underground.
Wine and roses ain't quite over, fate deals a losing hand
And I said: didn't mean to... did not mean to fail 
You didn't plan it, you over-ran it 

You wanna do it, you wanna 
You wanna do it when you wanna 
You wanna do it, do it when you wanna 

When you blow it, babe, You got to blow it right 
Oh baby, if you fake it, mama, Baby, fake with all your might 
When you fake it, mama, Please fake it right  (for yourself babe)

When you fake it baby,
You're fakin' it for your life, for your life, for your life, for your life 
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, Do it when you wanna 
Do it, do it, do it, Do it when you wanna 

Oh, I can have you, baby, But I don't know what to do, yeah 
Sometime, baby, nothin' I could do 
On the balance of a crystal, Payin' through the nose 
And when they couldn't resist you, I thought you'd go with the flow.

And now your stage is empty, bring down the curtain, baby please. 
Fold up your show 
Hadn't planned to, Could not stand to fry in it
Hadn't planned it, I over-ran it, (fryin) 
For your life, For your life."
30,Four Sticks ,"Oh, Baby, it's cryin' time, 
Oh, Baby, I got to fly. 
Got to try to find a way, 
Got to try to get away, 
'Cause you know I gotta get away from you, Babe. 

Oh, Baby, the river's red, 
Oh, Baby, in my head. 
There's a funny feelin' goin' on, 
I don't think I can hold out long. 

And when the owls cry in the night, 
Oh, Baby, Baby, when the pines begin to cry, 
Baby, Baby, Baby, how do you feel? 
If the river runs dry, Baby, 
How do you feel? 

Craze, Baby, the rainbow's end, 
Baby, it's just a den 
For those who hide, 
Who hide their love to depths of life 
And ruin dreams that we all knew so, Babe. 

And when the owls cry in the night, 
Oh, Baby, Baby, when the pines begin to cry, 
Oh, Baby, Baby, how do you feel? 
If the river runs dry, Baby, 
How do you feel? 

Baby, how do you feel?

Ooh yeah, brave I endure,
Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore,
And they can't hold the wrath of those who walk,
An' the boots of those who march.
Baby, through the roads of time so long ago."
31,Friends ,"Bright light almost blinding
Black night still there shining
I can't stop, keep on climbing
Looking for what I knew
Had a friend, she once told me
You got love, you ain't lonely
Now she's gone and left me only
Looking for what I knew

Mmm, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy just

Met a man on the roadside crying
Without a friend, there's no denying
You're incomplete, they'll be no finding
Looking for what you knew
So anytime somebody needs you
Don't let them down, although it grieves you
Some day you'll need someone like they do
Looking for what you knew

Mmm, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy just
I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy, It's very easy
It's very easy, It's easy, easy, yeah"
32,Gallows Pole ,"Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while,
Think I see my friends coming, Riding a many mile.
Friends, did you get some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my dear friends, To keep me from the Gallows Pole?
What did you bring me to keep me from the Gallows Pole?

I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold,
You know that we're too damn poor to keep you from the Gallows Pole.
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while,
I think I see my brother coming, riding a many mile.
Brother, did you get me some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my brother, to keep me from the Gallows Pole?

Brother, I brought you some silver,
I brought a little gold, I brought a little of everything
To keep you from the Gallows Pole.
Yes, I brought you to keep you from the Gallows Pole.

Hangman, hangman, turn your head awhile,
I think I see my sister coming, riding a many mile, mile, mile.
Sister, I implore you, take him by the hand,
Take him to some shady bower, save me from the wrath of this man,
Please take him, save me from the wrath of this man, man.

Hangman, hangman, upon your face a smile,
Pray tell me that I'm free to ride,
Ride for many mile, mile, mile.

Oh, yes, you got a fine sister, She warmed my blood from cold,
Brought my blood to boiling hot To keep you from the Gallows Pole,
Your brother brought me silver, Your sister warmed my soul,
But now I laugh and pull so hard And see you swinging on the Gallows Pole

Swingin' on the gallows pole!"
33,Going To California ,"Spent my days with a woman unkind, 
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
Made up my mind to make a new start, 
Going to California with an aching in my heart. 
Someone told me there's a girl out there 
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair. 

Took my chances on a big jet plane, 
Never let them tell you that they're all the same. 
The sea was red and the sky was grey, 
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today. 
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake,
As the children of the sun began to awake. 

Seems that the wrath of the Gods 
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow; 
I think I might be sinking. 
Throw me a line if I reach it in time,
I'll meet you up there where the path 
Runs straight and high. 

To find a queen without a king, 
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la 
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn 
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born. 
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams, 
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems."
34,Good Times Bad Times ,"In the days of my youth
I was told what it means to be a man
Now I've reached the age
I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try
I find my way to the same old jam

Good times, bad times
You know, I had my share
When my woman left home with a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

Sixteen I fell in love
With a girl as sweet as could be
Only took a couple of days 'till she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
When I whispered in her ear
I lost another friend, oh

Good times, bad times...

I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbors say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within' my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part"
35,Hats Off To (Roy) Harper ,"When I done quit hollerin' baby, I believe I'll shake 'em on down 
Get my babe, won't be late, You know by that I mean seconds late 
Ah, must I holler, Must I shake 'em on down, 
Well I've been mistreated, babe, I believe I'll shake 'em on down. 
Well I ain't no monkey. I can't climb no tree, 
No brown skin woman gonna make no monkey out of me, 
I ain't no monkey, Sure can't climb no tree, 
I been mistreated babe I believe I'll shake 'em on down, 
Well I've been mistreated babe I believe I'll shake 'em on down. 

Listen mama, Put on your mornin' gown' 
Put in your nightshirt Mama we gonna shake 'em down 
Must I holler? Must I shake 'em on down? 

Gave my baby a twenty dollar bill, 
If that don't get her, Sure my shot, shot, shot-gun will, 
Yeah, I gave my baby a twenty dollar bill, 
If that don't get that woman, I'm sure my shot-gun will."
36,Heartbreaker ,"Hey fellas, have you heard the news? You know that Annie's back in town? 
It won't take long just watch and see how the fellas lay their money down. 
Her style is new but the face is the same as it was so long ago, 
But from her eyes, a different smile like that of one who knows. 

Well, it's been ten years and maybe more since I first set eyes on you. 
The best years of my life gone by, here I am alone and blue. 
Some people cry and some people die by the wicked ways of love; 
But I'll just keep on rollin' along with the grace of the Lord above. 

People talkin' all around 'bout the way you left me flat, 
I don't care what the people say, I know where their jive is at. 
One thing I do have on my mind, if you can clarify please do, 
It's the way you call me by another guy's name when I try to make love to you. 
I try to make love but it ain't no use. 

Work so hard I couldn't unwind, get some money saved; 
Abuse my love a thousand times, however hard I tried. 
Heartbreaker, your time has come, can't take your evil way; 
Go away, Heartbreaker."
37,Hello Mary Lou ,"I said hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew, Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart

Passed me by one sunny day,
Thought of those big brown eyes my way
Ooh, I never did see you before 
I'm not one that gets around,
Swear my feet stuck to the ground
Ooh, I never did see you before 

I said hello, Mary Lou, ah, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew, Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
(Rock it, rock it, rock it!)

I saw your lips, I heard your voice,
Believe me, I just had no choice
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away
I'm not one that gets around,
Swear my feet stuck to the ground
Ooh, I never did see you before 

I said hello, Mary Lou, ah, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew, Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
I said hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart"
38,Hey Hey What Can I Do ,"Wanna tell you about the girl I love 
My she looks so fine 
She's the only one that I been dreamin' of 
Maybe someday she will be all mine 
I wanna tell her that I love her so 
I thrill with her every touch 
I need to tell her she's the only one I really love 

I got a woman, wanna ball all day 
I got a woman, she won't be true, no 
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time 
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true 

Sunday morning when we go down to church 
See the menfolk standin' in line 
I said they come to pray to the Lord 
With my little girl, looks so fine 
In the evening when the sun is sinkin' low 
Everybody's with the one they love 
I walk the town, Keep a-searchin' all around 
Lookin' for my street corner girl 

I got a woman, wanna ball all day 
I got a woman, she won't be true, no no 
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time 
I said I got a little woman and she won't be true 

In the bars, with the men who play guitars 
Singin', drinkin' and rememberin' the times 
My little lover does a midnight shift 
She followed around all the time 
I guess there's just one thing a-left for me to do 
Gonna pack my bags and move on my way 
Cause I got a worried mind 
Sharin' what I thought was mine 
Gonna leave her where the guitars play 

I got a woman, she won't be true, no no 
I got a woman, wanna ball all day 
I got a woman, stay drunk all the time 
I got a little woman and she won't be true 

(Hey hey what can I do) 

I said she won't be true 

(Hey Hey, What can I say?) 

Hey hey, what can I do 
I got a woman, she won't be true 
Lord, hear what I say 
I got a woman, wanna ball all day"
39,Hot Dog ,"Well I just got into town today 
To find my girl who's gone away 
She took the Greyhound at the General Store 
I searched myself I searched the town 
When I finally did sit down 
I find myself no wiser than before 

She said we couldn't do no wrong 
No other love could be so strong 
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer 
Now she took my heart she took my keys 
From in my old blue dungarees 
And I'll never go to Texas anymore 

* Chorus: Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do 
She took my love and walked right out the door 
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure 
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before 

I took her love at seventeen 
A little late these days it seems 
But they said heaven is well worth waiting for 
I took her word I took it all 
Beneath the sign that said ""U-haul"" 
She left angels hangin round for more 

Chorus 

I thought I had it all sewn up 
Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck 
But folks said she was after something more 
I never did quite understand 
All that talk about rockin' bands 
But they just rolled my doll right out the door 
Oh yeah, they just rolled my doll right out the door!"
40,Hots On For Nowhere ,"I was burned in the heat of the moment, 
Though it couldn't have been the heat of the day 
When I learned how my time had been wasted, 
(And a) tear fell as I turned away

Now I've got friends who will give me their shoulder, 
Event I should happen to fall
Time and his bride growing older 
I've got friends who will give me fuck all 

(On the) corner of Bleeker and nowhere 
In the land of not quite day 
A shiver runs down my backbone 
Face in the mirror turns grey

So (I) looked round to hitch up the reindeer
Searching hard trying to brighten the day
I turned around to look for the snowman 
To my surprise he'd melted away. 

As the moon and the stars call the order
Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
While the hope in my hands turns to clay 
I don't ask that my field's full of clover
I don't moan at opportunity's door
And if you ask my advice, take it slower
Then your story'd be your finest reward. 

Lost on the path to attainment 
Search in the eyes of the wise 
When I bled from the heart of the matter 
I started bleeding without a disguise 

Now everything's fine under heaven
Now and then you've got to take time to pause 
When you're down on the ground, don't be messin' around 
Or you'll land in a boat without oars 
Hey babe, Hey babe, Hey babe, 
I lost my way. 

Hey babe, Hey babe, 
I don't know where I'm gonna find it. 

Hey babe, Hey babe, 
Do you wanna know, 
Do you really, really, wanna help me, yeah? 

Let me tell you now, babe 
Let me tell you 
That it feels so good that it must be right 

Now my babe, 
Let me tell you 
That it feels so good that it must be right..."
41,Houses Of The Holy ,"Let me take you to the movies. Can I take you to the show 
Let me be yours ever truly. Can I make your garden grow 

From the houses of the holy, we can watch the white doves go 
From the door comes Satan's daughter, and it only goes to show. You know. 

There's an angel on my shoulder, In my hand a sword of gold 
Let me wander in your garden. And the seeds of love I'll sow. You know. 

So the world is spinning faster. Are you dizzy when you're stoned 
Let the music be your master. Will you heed the master's call 
Oh... Satan and man. 

Said there ain't no use in crying. Cause it will only, only drive you mad 
Does it hurt to hear them lying? Was this the only world you had? Oh-oh

Got me a girl and I kissed her and then and then... 
Whoops, oh Lordy, well I did it again. 
Now I got ten children of my own 
I got another child on the way that makes eleven. 
But I'm in constant heaven. 
I know it's all right in my mind 
'Cause I got a little schoolgirl and she's all mine 
I can't get through to her 'cause it doesn't permit 
But I'm gonna give her everything I've got to give.

Then you went and said goodbye
And found another guy

Somewhere I'll find

Hey, I love that little lady
I got to be her fool
Ain't no other like my baby

Because I get down on my knees
Oh, I pray that love won't die
And if I always try to please
I don't know the reason why, yeah

Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit of my love, I give to you girl

50,If It Keeps On Raining (Rough Mix) ,"If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break.
If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break.
When the levee breaks, have no place to stay.

I worked on the levee, mama goin' night and day.
I worked on the levee, mama goin' night and day.
Never worked so hard, levee's wonderin' away.
Oh no, oh no. Oh no, oh no.

Mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan.
Mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan.
It's got what it takes, gotta leave his home.

Crying won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good.
Crying won't help you, mama prayin' won't do you no good.
When the levee breaks, baby you've gotta move, gotta move now.

Keep on cryin', keep on truckin' along.
Keep on grindin', keep on truckin' along.
Been diggin' thousand years, like she never ever comin' home, oh well now.

Goin' home, goin' home,
Goin' home, goin' home,
Goin' home, goin' home, goin' home,
Goin' home, goin' home, goin' home,
Goin' home, goin' home, goin' home."
51,Immigrant song ,"We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
The hammer of the gods,
Will drive our ships to new lands,
To fight the horde singing and crying:
""Valhalla I am coming!""

On we sweep,
With thrashing oar.
Our only goal will be the western shore.

We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
How soft your fields so green,
Can whisper tales of gore,
Of how we calmed the tides of war,
We are your overlords.

On we sweep,
With thrashing oar.
Our only goal will be the western shore.

So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins,
For peace and trust can win the day despite all your losing.

And I hear them shouting under my feet 
And I know it's got to be real 
Oh, Lord, deliver me 
All the wrong I've done 
You can deliver me, Lord

*Chorus: Oh, oh, I need your love, I need your love 
Oh, I need your love, I just got to have 

So don't you let her, Oh, get under your skin

I hear you crying in the darkness, Don't ask nobody's help 
Ain't no pockets full of mercy baby, Cause you can only blame yourself 

Chorus 

Oh it's simple, All the pain that you go through 
You can turn away from fortune, fortune, Cause that's all that's left to you 
It's lonely at the bottom, Man, it's dizzy at the top 
But if you're standing in the middle, Ain't no way you're gonna stop 

Chorus 

Oh whatever that your days may bring 
No use hiding in a corner, Cause that won't change a thing 
If you're dancing in the doldrums, One day soon, it's got to stop, it's got to stop 
When you're the master of the off-chance, When you don't expect a lot

55,Kashmir ,"Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face, 
stars fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space, 
to be where I have been
To sit with elders of the gentle race,
this world has seldom seen
They talk of days for which they sit and wait, 
all will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace,
sounds caress my ears
But not a word I heard could I relay
the story was quite clear
Ohh oh
Ohh oh oh

Oooh, baby I've been flying
No, yeah, Mama, there ain't no denyin'
Oooh yeah, I've been flying, 
Mama, mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin'

All I see turns to brown, 
as the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand, 
as I scan this wasted land
Tryin' to find....Tryin' to find where I've been.

Oh, pilot of the storm that leaves no trace, 
like thoughts inside a dream
Heed the path that led me to that place, 
yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon,
I will return again
Like the dust that lufts high in June,
when moving through Kashmir.

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails, 
across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face,
along the straits of fear
Ohh ohh 
Ohh ohh 

When I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way they stay, yeah

Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down...

You know they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard and don't you know
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through

They choose the path where no one goes
They hold no quarter
They hold no quarter

Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you

They choose the path that no one goes
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
The pain without quarter
They ask no quarter
The dogs of doom are howling more"

Maybe more than enough. 
Oh Darling... walk a while with me 
You've got so much... 

Many have I loved - Many times been bitten 
Many times I've gazed along the open road. 

Many times I've lied - Many times I've listened 
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know. 

Many dreams come true and some have silver linings 
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold. 

Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing 
Many many men can't see the open road. 

Many is a word that only leaves you guessing 
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, ooh! 
You really ought to know..."

His wife would cook his meal
As he would change the wheel

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, Always knew what's goin on 
Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 
There ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom 

Worked for thirty years 
Sharing hopes and fears 
Dreamin' of the day 
He could turn and say 

Poor Tom, work's done, been lazin' out in the noonday sun 

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 

His wife was Annie Mae 
With any man a game she'd play
When Tom was out of town 
She couldn't keep her dress down 

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, always knew what's goin on 

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom 

And so it was one day 
People got to Annie Mae (?) 
Tom stood, a gun in his hand 
And stopped her runnin' around 

Poor Tom, Seventh Son, gotta die for what you've done 

All those years of work are thrown away

It's been a long time, been a long time, 
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time. Yes it has. 

It's been a long time since the book of love, 
I can't count the tears of a life with no love. 
Carry me back, carry me back, 
Carry me back, baby, where I come from. 
It's been a long time, been a long time, 
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time. 

Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight, 
Making vows that just can't work right. 
Open your arms, opens your arms, 
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in. 
It's been a long time, been a long time, 
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time."
74,Royal Orleans ,"One time love, take care how you use it 
Try to make it last all night, And if you take your pick 
Be careful how you choose it, Sometimes its hard to feel it bite 
Feel it bite. 

A man I know, went down to Louisiana, 
had himself a bad, bad fight 
And when the sun peeked through 
John Cameron with Suzanna,
He kissed the whiskers, left & right 
Whiskers! 

Now, now, now, fright subsides 
Out at a hotel in the quarter, our friends check in to pass the night
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water
Poor whiskers set the room alight.
Whiskers! 

Down on Bourbon street, You know it's right 
You can see my friend, they run around all through the night 
Most everywhere, Until the closet's bare 
Run for the razor, Doin' up my hair 

New Orleans queens, Sure know how to schmooze it 
Maybe for some that seems alright 
When I step out, strut down with my sugar 
She'd best not talk like Barry White! 

One time love, take care how you use it 
Try to make it last all night, And if you take your pick 
Be careful how you choose it, Sometimes its hard to feel it bite 
Feel it bite."
75,Shakin' All Over ,"When you move right up close to me
That's when I get shakes all over me

Quivers down my backbone
I got the shakes in my kneebone

I got the tremors in my thigh bone
Shakin' all over

When you move and say goodnight to me
That's when I get shakes all over me"

Since you've been bad with my lovin' baby
I don't think I'm gonna move into your neighbourhood.

Eh, I don't need no grocery boy

79,Somethin' Else ,"Hey, look here, what's all this?
There's a car made just for me 
To own that car would be a luxury 
A brand new convertible is out of my class 
I'll buy that car and I'll go ridin' around 
But that ain't no harm in thinking to myself 
That's fine lookin' man, it's something else 

Hey, look here, what's all this? 
I never thought I'd see this look before 
But here I am knockin' on her door 
Car's out front and it's all mine just a '41 Ford, '69

Ahh, she's the sweet, I'd like to meet

Maybe we'll go walking in the park

Both my feet are back on the ground 

And when the rhythm takes me 
It feels so good, oh so good

81,Stairway To Heaven ,"There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 

Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure 
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven. 

Ooh, it makes me wonder  x2

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving. 
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who stand looking. 

Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, really makes me wonder. 

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune 
Then the piper will lead us to reason. 
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long 
And the forests will echo with laughter. 

Ooh...

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run 
There's still time to change the road you're on. 

And it makes me wonder. 
Ooh...

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know 
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind. 


And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our souls. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who shines white light and wants to show 
How everything still turns to gold. 
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll. 

And she's buying a stairway to heaven..."
82,Stand By Me ,"When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light well see
No, I wont be afraid
No, I wont be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

So darling, darling,
Stand by me,
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand,
Stand by me
Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountains should crumble in the sea
I wont be afraid
I wont be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

So darling, darling,
Stand by me,
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand,
Stand by me
Stand by me

85,Tangerine ,"Measuring a summer's day,
 I only finds it slips away to grey, 
The hours, they bring me pain. 

Tangerine, Tangerine, 
Living reflection from a dream; 
I was her love, she was my queen, 
And now a thousand years between. 

Thinking how it used to be, 
Does she still remember times like these? 
To think of us again?
 And I do.

Living reflection from a dream; 
I was her love, she was my queen, 
And now a thousand years between."
86,Tea For One ,"How come twenty four hours, Baby sometimes seem to slip into days? 
Oh twenty-four hours, Baby sometimes seem to slip into days 
A minute seems like a lifetime, baby when I feel this way 
Sittin, lookin at the clock, time moves so slow 
I've been watchin for the hands to move 
Until I just can't look no more 
How come twenty four hours, Baby sometimes seems to slip into days? 
A minute seems like a lifetime, Baby when I feel this way. 

To sing a song for you, I recall you used to say 
""Oh baby this one's for we two"", Which in the end is you anyway 

How come twenty four hours, Baby sometimes slip into days? 
A minute seems like a lifetime, baby when I feel this way. 

There was a time that I stood tall, In the eyes of other men 
But by my own choice I left you woman, And now I can't get back again 

How come twenty-four hours, sometimes slip into days? 
A minute seems like a lifetime, Baby when I feel this way 
A minute seems like a lifetime 
When I feel this way...I feel this way"
87,Ten Years Gone ,"Then as it was, then again it will be 
An' though the course may change sometimes 
Rivers always reach the sea 
Blind stars of fortune, each have several rays 
On the wings of maybe, down in birds of prey 
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow 
But as the eagle leaves the nest, it's got so far to go 

Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me 
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be 

Did you ever really need somebody, And really need 'em bad 
Did you ever really want somebody, The best love you ever had 
Do you ever remember me, baby, did it feel so good 
'Cause it was just the first time, And you knew you would 

Through the eyes an' I sparkle, Senses growing keen 
Taste your love along the way, See your feathers preen 
Kind of makes makes me feel sometimes, Didn't have to grow 
We are eagles of one nest, The nest is in our soul 

Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me 
Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be 
Oh darlin', oh darlin' 

I'm never gonna leave you. I never gonna leave 
Holdin' on, ten years gone 
Ten years gone, holdin' on, ten years gone"
88,Thank You ,"If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you. 
When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me. 

Kind woman, I give you my all, Kind woman, nothing more. 

Little drops of rain whisper of the pain, tears of loves lost in the days gone by. 
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong, 
together we shall go until we die. My, my, my. 
An inspiration is what you are to me, inspiration, look... see. 

And so today, my world it smiles, your hand in mine, we walk the miles, 
Thanks to you it will be done, for you to me are the only one. 
Happiness, no more be sad, happiness....I'm glad.

89,That's The Way ,"I don't know how I'm gonna tell you, 
I can't play with you no more, 
I don't know how I'm gonna do what mama told me, 
My friend, the boy next door. 

I can't believe what people saying, 
You're gonna let your hair hang down, 
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long, 
You're in the darker side of town. 

And when I'm out I see you walking, 
Why don't your eyes see me, 
Could it be you've found another game to play, 
What did mama say to me. 

Ref.
That's The Way, Oh, That's The Way it ought to be, 
Yeah, yeah, mama say That's The Way it ought to stay. 

And yesterday I saw you standing by the river, 
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes, 
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying, 
Had they got you hypnotized? 

And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers, 
But all that lives is born to die. 
And so I say to you that nothing really matters, 
And all you do is stand and cry. 

I don't know what to say about it, 
When all you ears have turned away, 
But now's the time to look and look again at what you see, 
Is that the way it ought to stay? 

That's the way... 
That's the way it oughtta be.
Oh don't you know now, Mama said.. 
That's the way it's gonna stay, yeah."
90,The Battle Of Evermore ,"Queen of Light took her bow, and then she turned to go, 
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom, and walked the night alone. 
Oh, dance in the dark of night, sing to the morning light. 

The dark Lord rides in force tonight, and time will tell us all. 
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe, rest not to lock your homes. 
Side by side we wait the might of the darkest of them all. 

I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below, 
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, waiting for the eastern glow. 

The apples of the valley hold, the seeds of happiness, 
The ground is rich from tender care, repay, do not forget, no, no. 
Dance in the dark of night, sing to the morning light. 

The apples turn to brown and black, the tyrant's face is red. 
Oh the war is common cry, pick up you swords and fly. 
The sky is filled with good and bad that mortals never know. 

Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow, 
Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow. 

The pain of war cannot exceed the woe of aftermath, 
The drums will shake the castle wall, the ring wraiths ride in black, ride on. 
Sing as you raise your bow (ride on), shoot straighter than before. 

No comfort has the fire at night that lights the face so cold. 
Oh dance in the dark of night, sing to the morning light. 
The magic runes are writ in gold to bring the balance back. Bring it back.

At last the sun is shining, the clouds of blue roll by, 
With flames from the dragon of darkness, the sunlight blinds his eyes.

Bring it back.
Bring it back.
Bring it back.
Bring it back.

94,The Ocean ,"Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain 
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain 
Ain't no time to pack my bag, my foots outside the door 
Got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball. 

Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar 
Play for free, play for me and play a whole lot more, more! 
Singing about good things and the sun that lights the day 
I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost it's way. 

Sitting round singing songs 'til the night turns into day 
Used to sing on the mountains but the mountains washed away 
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart 
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start."
95,The Rain Song ,"This is the springtime of my loving
the second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
so little warmth I've felt before. 
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low. 

It is the summer of my smiles -
flee from me Keepers of the Gloom. 
Speak to me only with your eyes.
 It is to you I give this tune. 
Ain't so hard to recognize
These things are clear to all from 
time to time. 

Talk Talk
I've felt the coldness of my winter 
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, 'pon us, 'pon us...
But I know that I love you so 

These are the seasons of emotion 
and like the winds they rise and fall 
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold. 
This is the mystery of the quotient, quotient 
Upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall.
It's just a little rain oh yeah"
96,The Rover ,"I've been to London, seen seven wonders. I know to trip is just to fall 
I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it. I always knew what it was for. 

There can be no denyin' that the wind 'll shake 'em down 
And the flat world's flyin'. There's a new plague on the land 

If we could just join hands (X3) 

Traversed the planet when heaven sent me. I saw the kings who rule them all 
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight. I hear the rested rivers call 
And the wind is crying, from a love that won't grow cold 
My lover, she is lying, on the dark side of the globe 

If we could just join hands (X3) 

You got me rockin' when I ought to be a-rollin' 
Darlin', tell me, darlin', which way to go 
You keep me rockin', baby, then you keep me stolen 
Won't you tell me, darlin', which way to go... that's right 

Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry and I would dearly like to know 
I've all this wonder of earthly plunder will it leave us anything to show 

And our time is flyin' see the candle burnin' low 
Is the new world rising, from the shambles of the old 

If we could just join hands."
97,The Song Remains The Same ,"I had a dream. Crazy dream.
Anything I wanted to know, any place I needed to go

Hear my song. People won't you listen now? Sing along.
You don't know what you're missing now.
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow.
And it has to grow!

Honolulu Starbright - the song remains the same.

Sing out Hare Hare, dance the Hoochie Koo.
City lights are oh so bright, as we go sliding... sliding... sliding through."
98,The Wanton Song ,"Silent woman in the night, you came, Took my seed from my shaking frame. 
Same old fire, another flame, And the wheel rolls on. 

Silent woman through the flames, you come, From the deep behind the sun 
Seems my nightmares, have just begun 
Left me barely holding on. 

With blazing eyes you see my trembling hand. 
When we know the time has come 
Lose my senses, lose command 
Feel your healing rivers run 

Is it every time I fall, That I think this is the one 
In the darkness can you hear me call 
Another day has just begun. 

Silent woman, my face is changed 
Some know in ways to come. 
Feel my fire needs a brand new flame 
And the wheels rolls on.... rolls on."
99,Think it over ,"Think it over what you just said
Think it over in your pretty little head
Are you sure that Im not the one?
Is your love real or only fun?
You think it over, yes, think it over
A lonely heart grows cold and old

Think it over and let me know
Think it over but dont be slow
Just remember all birds and bees
Go by twos through lifes mysteries
You think it over, yes, think it over
A lonely heart grows cold and old

Think it over and think of me
Think it over and you will see
A happy day when you and I
Think as one and kiss the blues goodbye
You think it over, yes, think it over
A lonely heart grows cold and old

Think it over, over and over
Think it over, over and over"

I took a train, I met a dame
She was a babe, she was a real cool babe
She was from New York City
She was pretty
With a heave, and a ho
Couldn't let her go

Get along, sweet baby
My sweet baby
I just couldn't let...

We made a stop round Albuquerque
She must'a thought I was real gone jerk
She was pretty from New York City
Jack isn't she pretty or what?
WIth a heave, and a ho-ohhh
Couldn't let her go

The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long
The train kept a rollin' all night long

Version from Texas International Pop Festival August 31, 1969"
101,Trampled Underfoot ,"Greasy slicked down body, groovy leather trim 
I like the way you hold the road, mama, it ain't no sin 

Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 

Trouble-free transmission, helps your oil's flow 
Mama, let me pump your gas, mama, let me do it all 

Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 

Dig that heavy metal underneath your hood 
Baby, I could work all night, believe I've got the perfect tools 

Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 

A model built for comfort, really built with style 
Specialist tradition, mama, let me feast my eyes 

Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 

Factory air-conditioned, heat begins to rise 
Guaranteed to run for hours, mama it's a perfect size 

Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 

Groovin' on the freeway, gauge is on the red 
Gun down on my gasoline, I believe I'm gonna crack a head. 

Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 
I can't stop talkin' about... 

Come to me for service every hundred miles 
Baby, let me check your points, fix your overdrive 

Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 

Fully automatic, comes in any size 
Makes me wonder what I did, before we synchronized 

Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 

Feather-light suspension, coils just couldn't hold 
I'm so glad I took a look inside your showroom doors 

Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 

Oh, I can't stop talkin' about love."
102,Travelling Riverside Blues ,"Asked sweet mama, Let me be her kid 
She said, ""You might get hurt if you don't keep it hid"" 

Well I know my baby, If I see her in the dark 
I said I know my rider, If I see her in the dark 

Now, I goin' to Rosedale, Take my rider by my side 
Still barrelhouse, If it's on the riverside, yeah 
I know my baby, Lord, I said, ""is really sloppy drunk"" 
I know my mama, Lord, a brownskin, but she ain't no plum 

See my baby, tell her, Tell her hurry home 
Had no lovin', since my baby been gone 
See my baby, Tell hurry on home 
I ain't had, Lord, my right mind, Since my rider's been gone 

Hey, she promises, She's my rider 
I wanna tell you, She's my rider 
I know you're mine, She's my rider 
She ain't but sixteen, But she's my rider 

I'm goin' to Rosedale, Take my rider by side 
Anybody argue with me man, I'll keep them satisfied 
Well, see my baby, tell her, Tell her the shape I'm in 
Ain't had no lovin', Lord, since you know when 

Spoken: Why don't you come into my kitchen 

She's a kindhearted lady. She studies evil all the time 
She's a kindhearted woman. She studies evil all the time 

Squeeze my lemon 'til the juice runs down my leg 
Squeeze it so hard, I'll fall right out of bed 
Squeeze my lemon, 'til the juice runs down my leg 

Spoken: I wonder if you know what I'm talkin' about 

Oh, but the way that you squeeze it girl 
I swear I'm gonna fall right out of bed 

She's a good rider 
She's my kindhearted lady 
I'm gonna take my rider by my side 
I said her front teeth are lined with gold 
She's gotta mortgage on my body, got a lien on my soul 
She's my brownskin sugar plum...

103,Walter's walk ,"Oooh... Know I feel so strange looking out the door. 
Oooh...Tryin hard to change but can't let go. 
Oooh... Cryin' tears of pain and more and more. 
Oooh... Everyday is the same as the one before. 

I'm walkin' the floor over you.
I'm walkin' the floor.

Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold.
To the hand that takes your dreamless soul.

Oooh... Is it long to wait, is it much to pay? 
Oooh... Sometimes it's hard waiting for the day. 

You know it's hard. I said it's hard.
You know it's true. I said it's hard.
You know it's hard. You know it's true. 

Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost.
When you hear the call can you count the cost? 
As you stand alone do you wonder how? 
Can you step aside, does it matter now? 

Every love that's changed.
In the eye of the night. 
In the day everything.
She was smilin' a tear at her waters fall.

You know it's true. You know it's true now.

I'm walkin' the floor over you.
I'm walkin' the floor.
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost. 
When you hear the call can you count the cost? 
As you stand alone do you wonder how? 
Can you step aside, does it matter now? 

Does it matter now?"
104,We're Gonna Groove ,"Hear my baby comin' down the track 
Betcha my baby's comin' back 
Someday she'll get back to me 
We're gonna raise a family 

We're gonna groove, Yeah groove 
Yeah we're gonna groove 

We're gonna love... until the break of day 

Sweet as sweet as sweet can be 
You don't know whatcha do to me 
Let me say you're my one desire 
You just set my soul on fire 

Oh we're gonna groove,Yeah groove 
Yeah we're gonna groove 
We gonna love... until the break of day 

Sweet as sweet as sweet can be 
Lemme tell ya you don't know whatcha do to me 
You just set my soul on fire 
Woman you know you're my one desire... 

We gonna groove... (repeat)"
105,Wearing And Tearing ,"It starts out like a murmur 
Then it grows like thunder 
Until it bursts inside of you 
Try to hold it steady 
Wait until you're ready 
Any second now will do 
Throw the door wide open 
Not a word is spoken 
Anything that you want to do 

Ya know, ya know, ya know... 

Don't you feel the same way? 
Don't you feel the same way? 
But you don't know what to do 
No time for hesitatin' 
Ain't no time for hesitatin' 
All you got to do is move 
They say you're feeling blue, well 
I just found a cure 
It's a thing you gotta do, yeah 

Ya know, ya know, ya know... 

Now listen: You say your body's aching? 
I know that it's aching 
Chill bumps come up on you 
Yeah, the funny fool 
I love the funny fool 
?Just like foolin' after school? 
And then you ask for medication 
Who cares for medication 
When you've worn away the cure 

Ya know, ya know, ya know... 
Go back to the country 
Yeah, go back to the country 
Feel a change is good for you 
When you keep convincin' 
Ah, don't keep convincin' 
What's that creeping up behind a you? 
It's just an old friend 
It's just an old friend 
And what's that he's got for you? 

Ya know, ya know, ya know... 

Do your dance do your dance do your dance 
Oooooh, medication. Medication! Medication!"
106,What Is And What Should Never Be ,"And if I say to you tomorrow
Take my hand, child, come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be.

A-catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky
It won't, but the wind won't blow, we really shouldn't go
It only goes to show that you will be mine, by takin' our time

And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh, what fun it all would be
then what's to stop us, pretty baby
but what is and what should never be

A-catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky
It won't, but the wind won't blow, we really shouldn't go
It only goes to show that you will be mine, by takin' our time

So if you wake up with the sunrise
and all your dreams are still as new
and happiness is what you need so bad
Well, girl, the answer lies with you, yeah

A-catch the wind, see us spin
Sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky
It won't, but the wind won't blow, we really shouldn't go
It only goes to show that you will be mine, by takin' our time

hey-oh
A-well, the wind won't blow, and we really shouldn't go
and it only goes to show-whoa-whoa-whoa
Catch the wind, we're gonna see us spin
We're gonna sail, little girl
A-do-do-do, ba-ba-n-do, oh
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, yeah
Everybody I know seems to know me well
but does anyody know I'm gonna move like hell
A-baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, hey, I love ya
Baby, baby, babe, huh, oh, I love ya
Do, no, no, no, no, no, no, come on, now
I want you"
107,When The Levee Breaks ,"If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break (x2) 
When The Levee Breaks I'll have no place to stay

Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan (x2) 
It's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well

Doesn't it make you feel bad 
When you're tryin' to find your way home
You don't know which way to go? 
If you're goin' down South
They go no work to do
If you don't know about Chicago

Cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good (x2)
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move

All last night sat on the levee and moaned (x2) 
Thinkin' about my baby and my happy home

Going, going to Chicago...
Going to Chicago...
Sorry but I can't take you... 
Going down... going down now... going down...."

Messin' around with every guy in town, 
Puttin' me down for thinkin' of someone new. 
Always the same, playin' your game, 
Drive me insane, trouble is gonna come to you, 
One of these days and it won't be long, 
You'll look for me but baby, I'll be gone. 
This is all I gotta say to you woman: 

Ref.Your Time Is Gonna Come X4 

Made up my mind to break you this time, 
Won't be so fine, it's my turn to cry. 
Do want you want, I won't take the brunt. 
It's fadin' away, can't feel you anymore. 
Don't care what you say 'cause I'm goin' away to stay, 
Gonna make you pay for that great big hole in my heart. 
People talkin' all around, 
Watch out woman, no longer 
Is the joke gonna be on my heart. 
You been bad to me woman, 
But it's coming back home to you."
