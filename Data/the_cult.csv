0,83rd Dream ,"Four crows nailed to a wooden post
Bleed upon a barren field
An old way that I don't understand
It kinda touched me for a day

Four crows nailed to a wooden post
Bleed upon a barren field
An old way that I don't understand
You know, it kinda touched me for a day

There are no bright skies
Where the eagle flies
Suddenly inside me, inside me
I don't need

I am alive
I am alive
Hey, hey

So psychedelic, driving over the sun
Past the still sky trees and fields
To the place the great relics have kissed you know
It kinda touched me for a day

There are no bright skies
Where the eagle flies
Suddenly inside me, inside me
I don't need

I am alive
I am alive

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

1,A Cut Inside ,"I don't wanna be
Caught up in your scene
So little left of me

I gave you everything, I crawled
Watched you dance 'cross the floor
I need something to believe in
They don't know my name
Take the blame
They will hold you
Bind and choke you

Caught in the lie
Tears in my eyes
Thorns of this life
Cut inside
No heathens in Heaven
No sweet surrender
Outsiders forever
The ghost of our lives

We will never be
Caught in your belief
Get up off your knees

You took everything, I crawled
Watched you dance 'cross the floor
I need something to believe in
They don't know your name
Take the blame

Caught in the lie
With tears in my eyes
The bones of this life
Cut inside
No heathens in Heaven
No sweet surrender
Outsiders forever
Ghosts of our lives

No heathens in Heaven
No sweet surrender
Outsiders forever
The ghost of our lives"
2,A flower in the desert ,"Wait a minute, my friend
Don't pass me up for dead
As Babylon crumbles to sand
A sweet flower blossoms in my hand
Another day is ending for you
Another day

While I'm alive, you see my rivers flowing
Don't wanna be like you
There are no wild beasts in here, I know
There are no wild beasts in here, we know

And a voice of the people cries
As it drones on in monotone
Here is the news, it's all so sad, sad
Ooh, and those black and whites
But thy knew it
Took a few and those panties in acquainted ways
Come on
Come on
Come on away, yeah

Wait a minute, my friend
Don't pass me up for dead
As Babylon crumbles to sand
A sweet flower blossoms in my hand
Another day is ending for you
Another day, another day

I'm alive
You see my body burning
Burning up in here
There are no others in here, I know
There are no others in here, oh no
Burning up in here
You know, you know

Step a little closer
I wonder if you can
Remember me in this way"
3,A Pale Horse ,"Behold a grey horse
Death rides a pale horse
A crimson robed rider
With a whip in my hand

You in denim and leather
So louche and confused
With a wave in my hand
Ill crush your sweet skill

Yeah, you dont stand a chance

Mercy going to cut you right where you stand

Love in the shadows waiting
Hiding in the shadow waiting
Love in the shadows waiting for you
Love in the shadows waiting, waiting for you

Behold a grey horse
Death rides a pale horse
A crimson robed rider
With a whip in my hand

You should have killed me the first time
Going to live to regret it
Well, you dont stand a chance

Going to cut you right where you stand

Love in the shadows waiting
Hiding in the shadow waiting

11,Avalanche Of Light ,"I saw you running fast in a shard of moonlight
Saw you moving faster through the broken glass
Running through the hills with your death at your heels
All tripped out in your mirrors and feathers

They think they got you trapped but you're so much bolder
Love is everything, hate is smaller
Oh, heart of hearts
Oh, heart of hearts
And on it goes, the silence grows

I know in this life everything's wild, everything came from you
Look in your eyes, avalanche of light, so much more for fools
I know in this life, everything came from you
Feel in this life, everything's wild, everything came from you

Iggy softly weeps into your shoulder
His tears are warm, baby, but you're so much colder
Tears are falling down as you dance and dance
Bitches just want money but they'll soon get older

They think they got you trapped but you're so much bolder
Love is everything, hate is smaller
Oh, heart of hearts
Oh, heart of hearts
And on it goes, the silence grows

I know in this life everything's wild, everything came from you
Look in your eyes, avalanche of light, so much more for fools
I know in this life, everything came from you
Feel in this life, everything's wild, everything came from you
Came from you

Flash of the knife, your brilliant smile
There's more to this than blood and paper
They think they got you, you're so much bolder
There ain't no tome, you're so much wiser

I know in this life everything's wild, everything came from you
Look in your eyes, avalanche of light, so much more for fools
I know in this life, everything came from you
Feel in this life, everything's wild, everything came from you
Came from you
Everything came from you
Came from you
So much more for fools
I know in this life, everything came from you
Feel in this life, everything's wild, everything came from you
Came from you"

Shaken up and shattered
I pick myself from the floor
Those sweat stained dreams
All tattered and torn

Oh bleeding heart graffiti
I don't need it
Baby I don't need it
Oh bleeding heart graffiti
I don't need it
baby I don't need it

Amongst the broken glass now
You standing in the street
Times a crawling
My life slipping by
Although I hang my head down
To the grownd and I
Tired of crying
Those whiskey soaked tears

Oh bleeding heart graffiti
I don't need it
Baby I don't need it
Oh bleeding heart graffiti
I don't need it
baby I don't need it

I will follow the rainbow
To the end of the road and I
Didn't do you no harm, well woman
I'm a man waiting for the sun to shine
I have waited for too long, yea baby
Don't you cry now woman
Don't you cry now honey
'Cause sometime that sun is gonna shine on me, yea

33,Cortez the killer ,"He came dancing across the water
With his galleons and guns
Looking for the new world
In that palace in the sun

On the shore lay montezuma
With his coca leaves and pearls
In his halls he often wandered
With the secrets of the worlds.

And his subjects gathered 'round him
Like the leaves around a tree
In their clothes of many colours
For the angry gods to see.

And the women all were beautiful
And the men stood straight and strong
They offered life in sacrifice
So that others could go on.

Hate was just a legend
And war was never known
The people worked together
And they lifted many stones

They carried them to the flatlands
And they died along the way
But they built up with their bare hands
What we still can't do today.

And i know she's living there
And she loves me to this day
I still can't remember when
Or how i lost my way.

He came dancing across the water
Cortez, cortez
What a killer.

He came dancing ...

...so that others could go on...

He came dancing across the water
Cortez, cortez
What a killer...."

On the boulevard

Into these lesser, these lesser lights
Feel like somebody, feel like somebody tonight
Face the mirror, take the strain
When she kissed me, sweet Elektra in flames, in flames

Repel the ghosts, ignite the fates
Steal their gaze, won't hesitate

52,Ghost dance ,"Wovoka had a vision
His words went far and wide
Save our once great nation
And dance the dance of pride

Free me from my enemies and give me
Confidence and pride
From my heart I pledge my soul
To dance the dance of pride

Eeoheea, eeoheea
They cried
Hey, hey, hey

Free me from my enemies and give me

A circle lies in a square
A circle lies in a square
Not understanding
Gradually gaining inches
The dark corners are closing in

Of a black train-a-comin', no love
From the heart of the desert, no love
And the rhythms of my hometown

My eyes are open, no love
Watching for the train, no love, no love
Just a breath across the ocean
Feel no love
If it flies, it dies

Flags into a pocket, no love
We're standing on a platform
Feel no love
In everyone a hook line, no love, no love
Against me making time
Feel no love

Whisper in the wires, no love
Of a black train-a-comin', no love, no love
From the heart of the desert, no love
And the rhythms of my hometown
And the rhythms of my hometown
Feel no love
And the rhythms of my hometown"

In the tides of this world
You're a victim of fate
Give me mercy
Love will find you
Give me mercy
A new language
I don't know
Which way to turn
Other worlds with offerings of joy
Watch the butcher's knife
In his trembling hand
The end of a species
The shimmering veil
Give me mercy
Love will find you
Give me mercy
A new language
Give me mercy
Love will find you
Give me mercy
A new language
Give me mercy
Love will find you

Licking honey from a knife.

Twisted night, the hooker smiles
When does it end? When will it end?

East coast to the west coast

Said I was a threat
Flash of the truth came flying

You seduced me, I came undone
Cut right through me, I came undone
I never knew that I was done
Bleed out, bleed out, bleed out, bleed out

I awoke wolf on my chest
Breathing in my face

70,In the end ,"It starts with
One thing, i don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All i know is that
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all
Just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though i tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a
Memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

One thing, i don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind i designed this rhyme to remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like i was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so [far]
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though i tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a
Memory of a time when

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

I put my trust in you
Pushed as far as i can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as i can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all

76,Lay Down your Gun ,"Drifting in on a dust cloud parched and dirty from the ride
He tied his horse to a fence post and strapped a gun to his side
Across the square walked a lady Indian girl dressed in black
As she walked by she smiled and said as she walked by she said

Lay down your gun young boy lay down your gun young man
Lay down your gun young boy if you don't you're going to die

In her eye he saw a tear winter rose she gave to him
On his cheek she placed a kiss and prayed to set him free
Spotted the lady standing waiting there
With outstretched hands to stop that bloody bloody affair

Lay down your gun young boy if you don't you're going to die young man
Lay down your gun young boy if you don't you're going to die going to die
If you don't
Lay down stay down
Lay down lay down your gun young man
Lay down stay down young boy
Lay down your gun"

Leave his shell on the ground
What have you done
With your own life, your world

Shared everything i've been
Speak every thing i've seen
So kill your jealousy
And what you believe

You can’t destroy them
The beauty and the youth
You'll never beat them
You'll never hide the truth [x2]

I lay down
With the beasts on the ground
Where prophets cry
In every tear a prayer, forever

Shared everything i've been
Speak everything i've seen
So kill your jealousy
And what you still believe

You can’t destroy them
The beauty and the youth
You'll never beat them
You'll never hide the truth

Destroy destroy
Destroy it all
What I don't understand
Why you destroy everything
So beautiful in your hand

Hate strips it away
The essence of a man
We'll weave a golden noose
And hang you from the stars

You can make this right
Hey now

The power and the glory
Hey now

Blooms eventually decay
Reaching ecstasy through god's strained heart
Your innocent life, your immaculate heart

Walked with pilgrims in the snows
Dressed like wolves in these exotic lands
You showed me how to live
Another way

Older than the dawn
Once it seemed like fun
In this city of gold
Bleeding and fading away

You've got everything to lose
Turn these bruises into wine
Blooms eventually decay
Reaching ecstasy through god's strained heart

Dont be decided by the liars
Caught in the jaws and the flame
Ive been consumed by the trials
These wicked teeth that hold my name, that hold my name, that hold my name

Pages burn, I watch the words ignite
And my heart feels beyond this strife
Look into the black jaws of the night
Take back what I lost and

I give my heart to the heavens
I give my heart to the light

Will I see them again?
I dream of dreams to come and temples built with love
I’m not a slave.

This city lights are fading, calling me again
Like diamonds in the rain
Where prophets tag their name, her rivers filled with shame
Few faces stay the same.

The time will never end, the larger truth is in
My skies will show again.
My fire works ignite, the spirit now takes flight
And have the glory fame.

I don’t mess around
Throw your weapon to the ground
Now, witches gather round
They have to make no sound."

Raised from the ashes, twisted vines
Sirens and crushed metal
Suspended in this life

Lost in love's illusion
All will fade in time
Under the midnight sun
We're creatures of the wild
We're lost in love's illusion

The mortal fabric decays
No empire, just a wasteland
A song of crimson rage
From a bird within a cage

You’re not gonna fool us, you’re not gonna turn us inside out.

A shadow you take bathing,
While lonely bones repelling,
Our platus hearts don’t sense it.
Don’t want to give, you only take the light away.

You’re not gonna use us, you’re not gonna push us to the ground.
You’re not gonna fool us, you’re not gonna turn us inside out.
You’re not gonna use us, you’re not gonna push us to the ground.
You’re not gonna fool us, you’re not gonna smash our skulls and bones.

Scam to the highest, get through the fire
