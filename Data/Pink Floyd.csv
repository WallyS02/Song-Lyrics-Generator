1,Learning To Fly,"



Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone my senses reeled
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earth-bound misfit, I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought, I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladened empty and turned to stone
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try

Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

Mixtures - rich
Propellers - fully forward

Golf romeo-echo ready for departure
Romeo-echo listen out 129 decimal 4
129 4 listening out
Romeo-echo is cleared takeoff, the wind's north at ten knots
Romeo-echo
So, on the brake. Just be ready, it's gonna roll this time
Just feel the power gradually, and it...

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss

Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

2,The Dogs Of War,"



Dogs of war and men of hate
With no cause, we don't discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather 'round and haggle
For hard cash, we will lie and deceive
Even our masters don't know
The webs we weave

One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world ... One world

Invisible transfers and long distance calls
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
Has unleashed the dogs of war
You can't stop what has begun
Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have a dark side, to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world ... One world

The dogs of war won't negotiate
The dogs of war don't capitulate
They will take and you will give
And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door
But wherever you go
You know they've been there before
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain

One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world ... One world

3,One Slip,"



A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word her honour to defend

I will, I will she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I lead the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence

One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you won't forget
There'll be no sleep in here tonight

Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life to a life
The one regret, you will never forget
There'll be no sleep in here tonight

One slip... one slip...

4,On The Turning Away,"



On the turning away
From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won't understand
""Don't accept that what's happening
Is just a case of others' suffering
Or you'll find that you're joining in
The turning away""

It's a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we're all alone
In the dream of the proud

On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
Mesmerized as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It's not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there'll be
No more turning away?

5,Yet Another Movie,"



One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?

A man who ran, a child who cried
A girl who heard a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

The use of force, he was so tough
She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still

He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst, he's not the best

And still this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look

A man in black on a snow white horse
A pointless life has run its course
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun

8,Sorrow,"



The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking

He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can't be precise
He's chained forever to a world that's departed
It's not enough, it's not enough

His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

One world, one soul
Time pass, the river rolls

And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be

There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

9,Let There Be More Light,"



Far, far, far, far away, way
People heard him say, say
I will find a way, way
There will come a day, day
Something will be done

Then at last the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall

Now, now, now is the time, time
Time to be, be, be aware

Carter's father saw it there and
Knew the road revealed to him
The living soul of Hereward the Wake

Oh, my, something in my eye, eye
Something in the sky, sky
Waiting there for me

The outer lock rolled slowly back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes was Lucy in the sky

Oh, oh, did you ever know, know
Never ever will they
I can't say

Summoning his cosmic powers
And glowing slightly from his toes
His psychic emanations flowed

Remember a day before today
A day when you were young
Free to play along with time
Evening never comes

Sing a song that can't be sung
Without the morning's kiss
Queen you shall be if you wish
Look for your king

Why can't we play today?
Why can't we stay that way?

Climb your favorite apple tree
Try to catch the sun
Hide from your little brother's gun
Dream yourself away

Why can't we reach the sun?
Why can't we blow the years away?

11,Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun,"



Little by little the night turns around
Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning
Under the eaves the swallow is resting

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

Over the mountain watching the watcher
Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine
One inch of love is one inch of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun

Witness the man who raves at the wall
Making the shape of his question to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun

Dear oh dear, oh will they really laugh at me?

It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here
And I'm most obliged to you for making it clear
That I'm not here
And I never knew the moon could be so big
And I never knew the moon could be so blue
And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes
And brought me here instead dressed in red
And I'm wondering who could be writing this song

I don't care if the sun don't shine
And I don't care if nothing is mine
And I don't care if I'm nervous with you
I'll do my loving in the winter

And the sea isn't green
And I love the Queen
And what exactly is a dream?
And what exactly is a joke?

16,Dogs,"



You got to be crazy, gotta have a real need
Gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking.

And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile

You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in.

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up, fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer.

And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone
Dragged down by the stone.

I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?
Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
And everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.

Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone.

Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away
Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air
You better watch out
There may be dogs about
I've looked over Jordan and I have seen
Things are not what they seem

What do you get for pretending the danger's not real
Meek and obedient you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel
What a surprise
A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green he leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives he releaseth my soul
He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets
For lo, he hath great power and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection and great dedication
Master the art of karate
Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water

Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream

Have you heard the news?
The dogs are dead!
You better stay home
And do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old

And starts to climb towards the light

Strangers passing in the street

And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall

I'm so afraid
Of mistakes that I've made
Shaking every time that I awake
I feel like a cardboard cut-out man
So build me a time
When the characters rhyme
And the story line is kind

I've aged and aged since the first page
I've lived every line that you wrote
Take me down, take me down
From the shelf above your head
And build me a time 
When the characters rhyme
And the story line is kind

I live where I'm left
On the shelf like the rest
And the epilogue reads like a sad song
Please pick up your camera
And use me again
And build me a time 
When the characters rhyme
And the storyline is kind

Bridges burning gladly merging with the shadow
Flickering between the lines
Stolen moments floating softly on the air
Born on wings of fire and climbing higher

Ancient bonds are breaking
Moving on and changing sides
Dreaming of a new day
Cast aside the other way

Magic vision stirring
Kindled by and burning
Flames rise in her eyes

The door that stands ajar
The walls that once were high
Beyond the gilded cage
Beyond the reach of ties
The moment is at hand
She breaks the golden band

Come on, my friends, let's make for the hills
They say there's gold and I'm looking for thrills
You can get your hands on whatever we find
'Cause I'm only comin' along for the ride

Well, you go your way, I'll go mine
I don't care if we get there on time
Everybody's searching for something, they say
I'll get my kicks on the way

Over the mountains, across the sea
Who knows what may be waiting for me?
I could sail forever to strange sounding names
Faces of people and places don't change

All I have to do is just close my eyes
To see the seagulls wheeling in those far distant skies
All I wanna tell you, all I wanna say
Is count me in on the journey, don't expect me to stay

Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there's a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I'm growing old

Flash the readies wot's...uh the deal?
Got to make it to the next meal
Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel

Turn to speak but you're alone
Million miles from home you're on your own

So let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there's a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I'm growing old

Fire bright by candlelight
And her by my side
And if she prefers we never stir again

Someone sent the promised land
And I grabbed it with both hands

You shout in your sleep
Perhaps the price is just too steep
Is your conscience at rest
If once put to the test?
You awake with a start
To just the beating of your heart
Just one man beneath the sky
Just two ears, just two eyes

You set sail across the sea
Of long past thoughts and memories
Childhood's end, your fantasies
Merge with harsh realities
And then as the sail is hoist
You find your eyes are growing moist
And all the fears never voiced
Say you have to make your final choice

Who are you and who am I
To say we know the reason why?
Some are born; some men die
Beneath one infinite sky
There'll be war, there'll be peace
But everything one day will cease
All the iron turned to rust
All the proud men turned to dust
And so all things, time will mend
So this song will end

And death is a long, cold rest

Eighty years, with luck, or even less

And maybe you'll make it to the top
And mind how you go, and I can tell you, 'cause I know

You are the angel of death
And I am the dead man's son
And he was buried like a mole in a fox hole
And everyone is still on the run

And who is the master of fox hounds?
And who says the hunt has begun?

Fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees

Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbours turn away
And there's a change that even with regret
Cannot be undone

When all the clouds (And hurled into the furnace he'll)

In a world of magnets and miracles

There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener

And everyone has recourse to the law

And no one kills the children anymore

70,Southampton Dock,"



They disembarked in '45
And no one spoke and no one smiled
There were too many spaces in the line

And gathered at the cenotaph
All agreed with hand on heart
To sheath the sacrificial knives

But now
She stands upon
Southampton Dock
With her handkerchief
And her summer frock
Clings to her wet body in the rain

In quiet desperation
Knuckles white upon the slippery reins
She bravely waves the boys goodbye again

And still the dark stain spreads between
Their shoulder blades
A mute reminder
Of the poppy fields and graves
And when the fight was over
We spent what they had made
But in the bottom of our hearts
We felt the final cut

71,The Final Cut,"



Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes
I can barely define the shape of this moment in time
And far from flying high in clear blue skies
I'm spiralling down to the hole in the ground where I hide

If you negotiate the minefield in the drive
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes
And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall
Dial the combination, open the priesthole
And if I'm in I'll tell you (what's behind the wall)

(Wahoo!)

There's a kid who had a big hallucination
Making love to girls in magazines
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith
Could anybody love him?
Or is it just a crazy dream?

And if I show you my dark side
Will you still hold me tonight?
And if I open my heart to you
And show you my weak side
What would you do?

Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
Would you take the children away
And leave me alone?
And smile in reassurance
As you whisper down the phone
Would you send me packing?
Or would you take me home?

Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down
I held the blade in trembling hands
Prepared to make it but â just then the phone rang
I never had the nerve to make the final cut

In my rear-view mirror the sun is going down
Sinking behind bridges in the road
I think of all the good things
That we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions
Confirm suspicions
Of the holocaust to come

The rusty wire
That holds the cork
That keeps the anger in
Gives way
And suddenly it's day again

The sun is in the east
Even though the day is done
Two suns in the sunset
Could be the human race is run

Like the moment when the brakes lock
And you slide towards the big truck
Oh, no
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear

And you'll never hear their voices
Daddy, daddy, 
And you'll never see their faces
You have no recourse to the law anymore

And as the windshield melts
And my tears evaporate
Leaving only charcoal to defend
Finally I understand
The feelings of the few
Ashes and diamonds
Foe and friend
We were all equal in the end

...and now the weather. Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers spreading from the east ... with an expected high of 4000 degrees Celsius.""

With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showered silver on the people

Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?

Across the stream with wooden shoes
Bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time

Wandering and dreaming
The words had different meaning
Yes, they did

For all the time spent in that room
The doll's house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by

Waiting to follow the worms

Waiting to turn on the showers and fire the ovens
Waiting for the queens and the coons and the reds and the Jews
Waiting to follow the worms

Would you like to see Britannia rule again
My friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms

Would you like to send our coloured cousins home again
My friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms

[Prosecutor:]
Good morning, the Worm your honour
The crown will plainly show
The prisoner who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do

Call the schoolmaster!

[Teacher:]
I always said he'd come to no good
In the end, your honour
If they'd let me have my way
I could have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder
Let me hammer him today

[Pink:]
Crazy
Toys in the attic,
I am crazy
Truly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away

[Choir:]
Crazy
Toys in the attic
He is crazy

[Wife:]
You little shit, you're in it now
I hope they throw away the key
You should've talked to me more often than you did,
But no, you had to go your own way.
Have you broken any homes up lately?

""Just five minutes, Worm your honour, him and me alone""

[Mother:]
Babe
Come to mother, baby, let me hold you in my arms
M'Lord I never wanted him to get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm your honour, let me take him home

[Pink:]
Crazy
Over the rainbow
I am crazy
Bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in

[Choir:]
Crazy
Over the rainbow
He is crazy

[Worm:]
The evidence before the court is incontrovertible.
There's no need for the jury to retire.
In all my years of judging
I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving the full penalty of law.
The way you made them sufferâ
Your exquisite wife and motherâ
Fills me with the urge to defecate
(Go on, judge. Shit on him.)
Since, my friend, you have revealed
Your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers.

Tear down the wall

Tear down the wall [repeat]

All alone or in twos
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down outside the wall

Some hand in hand
And some gathered together in bands
The bleeding hearts and the artists make their stand

And when they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy
Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall

Isn't this where we...

A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down

Around the icy waters underground

111,Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun (Live),"



Little by little the night turns around
Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning
Under the eaves the swallow is resting

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

Over the mountain watching the watcher
Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine
When one inch of love is one inch of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun...

Witness the man who raves at the wall
Making the shape of his question to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun...

Icy wind of night, be gone
This is not your domain
In the sky a bird was heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied a deathly silence that lay all around

Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea

In the lazy water meadow
I lay me down
All around me
Golden sun flakes settle on the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room

Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea

In the lazy water meadow
I lay me down
All around me
Golden sun flakes covering the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into my city room

Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea

Aye an' a bit o' mackerel, fiddler, rack and fear
And I rutted down by the hade and the furrow
Well, I slapped me in a flop and hit down and I shied
And I cried, cried, cried
The fear of fallin' down aft' taken, never back to rise
And then cried 'Mary!' and I tucked up
Wi' a Claymore out and about
And I run down, down the mechyn sty
And beckoned the fiery whore
That was fallin' around the feet
""Never"", I cried. ""Never shall ye get me alive
Ya rotten hound of the Burnie Brae""
Well, I snapped for a blade and a Claymore cut and thrust
And I fell down before him 'round his feet

Aye, a roar he cried! Frae the bottom of his heart
That I would nay fall but dead, dead as a can by a feat deah
And the wind cried back

[Part 3]

Following the path as it leads towards
The darkness in the North
Weary strangers' faces show their sympathy
They've seen that hope before

But if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your aching eyes, be on your way

Mist is swirling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar get louder in your ears
You know, the folly was your own
But the force behind can't conquer all your fears

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your aching eyes, be on your way

Throw your thoughts back many years
To the time when there was life in every morning
Perhaps a day will come
When the lights will be as clear as on that morning

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your aching eyes, be on your way

Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom, blown on the steel breeze.
Come on you target for faraway laughter, come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!

You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision, rode on the steel breeze.
Come on you raver, you seer of visions, come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!

Where have you been? It's alright we know where you've been.
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time, 
provided with toys and Scouting for Boys.
You bought a guitar to punish your ma,
And you didn't like school, and you know you're nobody's fool,
So welcome to the machine.
Welcome my son, welcome to the machine.
What did you dream? It's alright we told you what to dream.
You dreamed of a big star, he played a mean guitar,
He always ate in the Steak Bar. He loved to drive in his Jaguar.

Well, I've always had a deep respect
And I mean that most sincerely
The band is just fantastic
That is really what I think
Oh by the way, which one's Pink?

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it Riding the Gravy Train

We're just knocked out
We heard about the sell out
You gotta get an album out
You owe it to the people
We're so happy we can hardly count

Everybody else is just green
Have you seen the chart?
It's a hell of a start
It could be made into a monster
If we all pull together as a team

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it Riding the Gravy Train

So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
Running over the same old ground.
What have we found?
The same old fears.
Wish you were here.

sail on the steel breeze.
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser, 
come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine
