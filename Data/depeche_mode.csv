0,A Pain That I'm Used To ,"I'm not sure what I'm looking for anymore 
I just know that I'm harder to console 
I don't see who I'm trying to be instead of me 
But the key is a question of control 

Can you say what you're trying to play anyway 
I just pay while you're breaking all the rules 
All the signs that I find have been underlined 
Devils thrive on the drive that is fueled 

All this running around, well it's getting me down 
Just give me a pain that I'm used to 
I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive 
You just need to achieve something that rings true 

There's a hole in your soul like an animal 
With no conscience, repentance unknown 
Close your eyes, pay the price for your paradise 
Devils feed on the seeds of the soul 

I can't conceal what I feel, what I know is real 
No mistaking the faking, I care 
With a prayer in the air I will leave it there 
On a note full of hope not despair 

All this running around, well it's getting me down 
Just give me a pain that I'm used to 
I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive 
You just need to achieve something that rings true"
1,A Photograph Of You ,"What good is a photograph of you? 
Everytime I look at it, 
It makes me feel blue! 

What use is a souveneir 
Of something we once had, 
When all it ever does is 
Make me feel bad! 

I wish I could tear it up, 
But then again I haven't the guts! 
I wish I could throw it on the fire 
I wish I could, 
But to say I would, 
I'd be a liar! 

What good is a colour print 
Of a little baby doll? 
When just one little glance 
Is enough to make me feel dull! 

I hoped I would misplace it, 
But then I take such good care of it. 
I wish it would disappear, 
I say I wish, 
But then I relish 
It being here! 

What good is a photograph of you? 
Everytime I look at it, 
It makes me feel blue. 
What good is a photograph of you? 
Everytime I look at it, 
It makes me feel blue. 

Feel blue."
2,A Question Of Lust ,"Fragile 
Like a baby in your arms 
Be gentle with me 
I'd never willingly 
Do you harm 

Apologies 
Are all you seem to get from me 
But just like a child 
You make me smile 
When you care for me 
And you know... 

It's a question of lust 
It's a question of trust 
It's a question of not letting 
What we've built up 
Crumble to dust 
It is all of these things and more 
That keep us together 

Independence 
Is still important for us though (we realise) 
It's easy to make 
The stupid mistake 
Of letting go (do you know what I mean) 

My weaknesses 
You know each and every one (it frightens me) 
But I need to drink 
More than you seem to think 
Before I'm anyone's 
And you know... 

It's a question of lust 
It's a question of trust 
It's a question of not letting 
What we've built up 
Crumble to dust 
It is all of these things and more 
That keep us together 

Kiss me goodbye 
When I'm on my own 
But you know that I'd 
Rather be home 

It's a question of lust 
It's a question of trust 
It's a question of not letting 
What we've built up 
Crumble to dust 
It is all of these things and more 
That keep us together (x3)"
3,A Question Of Time ,"I've got to get to you first 
Before they do 
It's just a question of time 
Before they lay their hands on you 
And make you just like the rest 
I've got to get to you first 
It's just a question of time 

Well now you're only fifteen 
And you look good 
I'll take you under my wing 
Somebody should 
They've persuasive ways 
And you'll believe what they say 

It's just a Question of Time
And it's running out for you
It won't be long until you do
Exactly what they want you do

I can see them now 
Hanging around 
To mess you up 
To strip you down 
And have their fun 
With my little one 

It's just a Question of Time
And it's running out for you
It won't be long until you do
Exactly what they want you do

Sometimes I don't blame them 
For wanting you 
You look good 
And they need something to do 
Until I look at you 
And then I condemn them 
I know my kind 
What goes on in our minds 

It's just a question of time 
It's just a question of time
It should be better
It's just a question of time
It should be better with you
It should be better
It should be better with you"
4,Addiction ,"I can't help it, I'm not sure what to do
Does seem crazy, no good for my health
I've seen the doctor, he's come to look at me
If you don't believe it, don't believe

Closer all the time, Closer all the time
Closer all the time, Closer all the time

Now I'm saying how I'm going to need a pill
I need you like a drug to keep my fill
I can't remember everything I do
Now I put them, it's only good to you

Closer all the time, Closer all the time
Closer all the time, Closer all the time

You can't help but look me in the eye
While I come running, I don't know why
It's an addiction, image of love
Your heart pushing, angel from above

Closer all the time, Closer all the time
Closer all the time, Closer all the time
Closer all the time, Closer all the time
Close!"
5,All That`s Mine ,"I know it's hard to reach you
I know It's hard to breathe
I know it's hard to be you sometimes
I can't imagine what that means
This must be someone else's story
I can't follow what you've planned
How can this be about me
Am I suppose to understand

Like a ship on the ocean
Heading out to sea
You can hardly see it now
It's a lot like you
Lost like me

You're still looking for redemption
Still can't find a trace
If there is nothing after
There'll be no saving Grace
I'm giving you control now
I need some kind of sign
Come take away this sorrow now
I gave you all that's mine

Like a ship on the ocean
Heading out to sea
You can hardly see it now
It's a lot like you

Like a ship on the ocean
Heading out to sea
You can hardly see it now
It's a lot like you
Lost like me"
6,Alone ,"I was there when you needed me most
 I was there when you wanted me least
 I was your father, your son and your holy ghost and priest

Through your failings and success
 Through your losses and gains
 I didn’t see much happiness or pain

I couldn’t save your soul
 I couldn’t even take you home
 I couldn’t fill that hole
 Alone

I saw you at your best
 I knew you at your worst
 I couldn’t tell if you were blessed or cursed
 There’s a thin grey line between the black and the white
 It’s evidently hard to find at night

I couldn’t save your soul
 I couldn’t even take you home
 I couldn’t play that role
 Alone

Now it’s too…
 Too late for words that should have been said
 Long ago

I was there when you needed me most
 I was there when you wanted me least
 I was your father, your son and your holy ghost and priest

I couldn’t save your soul
 I couldn’t even take you home
 I couldn’t fill that hole
 Alone"
7,Always ,"The well is dry 
and the stream runs shallow
And the sun is high 
and the field lies fallow
My tongue is tied 
and my body aching
Now I'm open wide 
and afraid of breaking

The food is hot 
and the table's  eady
But my stomach's knots 
make my hands unsteady
So I take to pacing 
up and down the room
While my heart keeps racing 
and my mind's consumed

I just want to be part
Of the light, of the light, of the light
Of the light in your eyes
I just want to be part
Of the light, of the light, of the light
Of the light in your eyes

The bed is made 
and the candles burning
All our games are played 
and the clock keeps turning
We're out of tricks 
with the silence cutting
With the dagger stick 
as the doors keep shutting

I just want to be part
Of the fight, of the fight, of the fight
Of the fight in your eyes
I just want to be part
Of the fight, of the fight, of the fight
Of the fight in your eyes

Always, always
Always, always
(Forever)
Always
(Forever)"
8,Always You ,"My love, the world's upside down
My love, no solid ground
My love, there are no more facts
My love, reality's cracked

And then there's you
There's always you
You're all I need to keep believing
And then there's you
There's always you
The air that keeps my spirit breathing
And then there's you
There's always you, there's always you
There's always you, there's always you
There's always you
My love, there are no more words
My love, life's too absurd
My love, I could not explain
My love, why insanity reigns

And then there's you
There's always you
The light that leads me from the darkness
And then there's you
There's always you
Your grace and holiness are endless
And then there's you
There's always you, there's always you
There's always you, there's always you
There's always you
And then there's you
There's always you, there's always you
There's always you, there's always you
There's always you"
9,And Then... ,"And Then...

Let's take a map of the world 
Tear it into pieces 
All of the boys and the girls 
Will see how easy it is 

To pull it all down and start again 
From the top to the bottom and then 
I'll have faith or, I prefer 
To think that things couldn't turn out worse 

All that we need as the start's 
Universal revolution (That's all!) 
And if we trust in our hearts 
We'll find the solutions 

Took a plane across the world 
Got in a car 
When I reached my destination 
I hadn't gone far 

Let's take the whole of the world 
The mountains and the sand 
Let all the boys and the girls 
Shape it in their hands"
10,Angel ,"The angel of love was upon me
And Lord I felt so small
The legs beneath me weakened
And I began to crawl
Confused and contented
I slithered around
With feelings beyond me
I was lost, I was found

The angel of love was upon me
And Lord I felt so weak
I felt my tongue move in my mouth
And I began to speak
A strange kind of language
I don't understand
A babbling fountain
I couldn't have planned

Oh leave me here forevermore
I've found the peace I've been searching for

The angel of love was upon me
And Lord I felt so high
I swear I could have reached up
Placed my hands upon the sky
A radiant rainbow was following me around
With elevated senses I could see and taste sound
The angel of love was upon me
And Lord I felt so clean
Like a preacher on Sunday
My heart was serene
I waded into the water
I was bathed, I was drowned
Like all sinners before me
I knelt down on the ground

Oh leave me here forevermore
I've found the peace I've been searching for
Oh let me sleep forevermore
I've found the peace I've been searching for"
11,Any Second Now (Voices)  ,"She remembered all the shadows and the doubts
The same film

Vivid pictures like a wall that's standing empty
And the night so still

Such a small affair, a relapse
Someone closing like the nightclub door

Here again and when you speak
I watch you move away
And seem so sure

She is hoping to forget
And the moment almost slips away

When the colours move apart
And I wonder if you want to stay

And I need to change you
Like the words I'm reading
Don't you understand

This the warning and the message
I remember as you touch my hand"
12,Are People People? ,"dang dang dang dang dang
zoom zoom zoom
bop bop bop"
13,Barrel Of A Gun ,"Do you mean this horny creep set upon weary feet 
Who looks in need of sleep that doesn't come 

Mmm

This twisted, tortured mess, this bed of sinfulness 
Who's longing for some rest and feeling numb 

What do you expect of me?
What is it you want?
Whatever you've planned for me
I'm not the one 

A vicious appetite visits me each night 
And won't be satisfied, won't be denied 

Mmm

An unbearable pain a beating in my brain 
That leaves the mark of cain right here inside 

What am I supposed to do
When everything that I've done 
Is leading me to conclude 
I'm not the one 

Whatever I've done 
I've been staring down the barrel of a gun 
Whatever I've done 
I've been staring down the barrel of a gun 
Whatever I've done 

Is there something you need from me?
Are you having your fun?
I never agred to be 
Your holy one 

Whatever I've done 
I've been staring down the barrel of a gun
Whatever I've done 
I've been staring down the barrel of a gun 
Whatever I've done 
I've been staring down the barrel of a gun"
14,Before We Drown  ,"I've been thinking I can come back home
So how would that be, you and I alone?

All alone

I have a feeling, you're not on my side
There's a distance, between you and I
You and I

First we stand up, then we fall down
We have to move forward, before we drown
We drown

I feel so naked, standing on the shore
Are you sure?
Nothing's out there, nothing else no more
No more

First we stand up, then we fall down
We have to move forward, before we drown
We drown

We drown

First we stand up, then we fall down
We have to move forward, before we drown
We drown"
15,Behind The Wheel ,"My little girl 
Drive anywhere 
Do what you want 
I don't care 
Tonight 
I'm in the hands of fate 
I hand myself 
Over on a plate 
Now 

Oh little girl 
There are times when I feel 
I'd rathern not be 
The one behind the wheel 
Come 
Pull my strings 
Watch me move 
I do anything 
Please 

Sweet little girl 
I prefer 
You behind the wheel 
And me the passenger 
Drive 
I'm yours to keep 
Do what you want 
I'm going cheap 
Tonight 

You're behind the wheel tonight"
16,Better Days ,"What are you hiding from
You are part of the sum
What has been going on
Your confidence has gone

You have seen better days
You have lived better ways

What are you waiting for
Answers that question more
Unexpected they will come
Are you expecting some

You have seen better days
You have lived better ways

Only time will tell
What will come of you
Only crime could sell
What you're trying to

Where are you heading to
What plans will you pull through
With trouble in the wings
Will you risk anything

You have seen better days
You have lived better ways"
17,Black Celebration ,"Let's have a black celebration 
Black celebration 
Tonight 

To celebrate the fact 
That we've seen the back 
Of another black 
Day 

I look to you 
How you carry on 
When all hope is gone?
Can't you see?

Your optimistic eyes 
Seem like paradise 
To someone like 
Me 

I want to take you in my arms 
Forgetting all I couldn't do today 

Black celebration 
Black celebration 
Tonight 

To celebrate the fact 
That we've seen the back 
Of another black 
Day 

I look to you 
And your strong belief 
Me, I want relief 
Tonight 

Consolation 
I want so much 
Want to feel your touch 
Tonight 

Take me in your arms 
Forgetting all you couldn't do today 

Black celebration 
Black celebration

Black celebration
I'll drink to that

I'll drink to that 

Black celebration

18,Black Day ,"Celebrate the fact 
That we've see the back 
Of another black day 

Black day 
Black day 

I want to take you in my arms 
Forgeting all I couldn't do today 

Black day 
Black day"
19,Blasphemous Rumours ,"Girl of sixteen, whole life ahead of her 
Slashed her wrists, bored with life 
Didn't succeed, thank the Lord 
For small mercies 

Fighting back the tears, mother reads the note again 
Sixteen candles burn in her mind 
She takes the blame, it's always the same 
She goes down on her knees and prays 

I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours 
But I think that God's got a sick sense of humor 
And when I die I expect to find Him laughing 

Girl of eighteen, fell in love with everything 
Found new life in Jesus Christ 
Hit by a car, ended up 
On a life support machine 

Summer's day, as she passed away 
Birds were singing in the summer sky 
Then came the rain, and once again 
A tear fell from her mother's eye 

I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours 
But I think that God's got a sick sense of humor 
And when I die I expect to find Him laughing"
20,Blue Dress ,"Put it on 
And don't say a word 
Put it on 
The one that I prefer 

Put it on 
And stand before  my eyes 
Put it on 
Please don't question why 
Can you believe 

Something so simple 
Something so trivial 
Makes me a happy man 
Can't you understand 
Say you believe 

Just how easy 
It is to please me 

Because when you learn 
You'll know what makes the world turn 

Put it on 
I can feel so much 
Put it on 
I don't need to touch 

Put it on 
Here before my eyes 
Put it on 
Because you realise 
And you believe 

Something so worthless 
Serves a purpose 
It makes me a happy man 
Can't you understand 
Say you believe 

Just how easy 
It is to please me 

Because when you learn 
You'll know what makes the world turn"
21,Boys Say Go! ,"Boys say go, boys say go
Boys say go, boys say go

You don't understand
This is a demand
And I think that I have to show you
Try to look inside
Take me for a ride
In the day and the night 
Get to know you

Boys meet boys get together
Boys meet boys it's forever
Don't say no
Boys say go

I can run away
If you never stay
And the rain and the pain and the sorrow
I'm not very sure 
When you close the door
If the end is the same as tomorrow

Boys meet boys get together
Boys meet boys it's forever
Don't say no
Boys say go

Boys, boys, boys, boys
Boys say go

You don't understand
This is a demand
And I think that I have to show you
Try to look inside
Take me for a ride
In the day and the night 
Get to know you

Boys meet boys get together
Boys meet boys it's forever
Don't say no
Boys say go

Go, go, go, go"
22,Breathe ,"I heard a rumour 
They travel far 
You know what it's like 
The way people are 
They talk and they talk 
Though they don't understand 
They'll whisper and whisper 
And lie on demand 
Please tell me now 
I want to know 
I have to hear it from your lips 
Say it's not so 

I heard it on Monday 
And I laughed a while 
I heard it on Tuesday 
I managed to smile 
I heard it on Wednesday 
My patience was tried 
I heard it on Thursday 
And I hurt inside 
I want to know 
The depths of your mind 
Tell me this whole thing is madness 
And we're doing fine 
Put your little hand in mine 
And believe in love 
Put your head on my chest 
And breathe love 
Breathe love 
Breathe love 
Breathe love 

I heard it from Peter 
Who heard it from Paul 
Who heard it from someone 
I don't know at all 
I heard it from Mary 
Who heard it from Ruth 
Who swore on the bible 
She's telling the truth 
I heard it from Simon 
Who heard it from James 
Confirming with Sarah 
That I was to blame 
I heard it from Joseph 
Who heard it from John 
Who said with conviction 
That all hope was gone 
So I need to know 
Your alibis 
I need to hear that you love me 
Before you say goodbye 
Before you say goodbye 
Before you say goodbye 
Before you say goodbye"
23,Broken ,"If you want control
Without any pain
How long will you suffer
How long will you reign

You see the friend that I knew
Cannot be found
Replaced by another
Wearing his crown

There’s a place where I go
Without any sound
Only you can reach me
Only you’re allowed

Then you’re so far away
You’re so far from here
Do you remember
A time without tears

When you’re falling I will catch you
You don’t have to fall that far
You can make it, I will be there
You were broken from the start

When you were a child
You’d dream all day long
You’d dream of the future
And get lost in your songs

Now that time is gone
It’s lost for you now
Words long forgotten
Forgotten somehow

When you’re falling I will catch you
You don’t have to fall that far
You can make it, I will be there
You were broken from the start"
24,But Not Tonight ,"Oh God, it's raining 
But I'm not complaining 
It's filling me up 
With new life 

The stars in the sky 
Bring tears to my eyes 
They're lighting my way 
Tonight 

And I haven't felt so alive 
In years 

Just for a day 
On a day like today 
I'll get away from this 
Constant debauchery 

The wind in my hair 
Makes me so aware 
How good it is to live 
Tonight 

And I haven't felt so alive 
In years 

The moon 
Is shining in the sky 
Reminding me 
Of so many other nights 
But they're not like tonight 

Oh God, it's raining 
And I'm not containing 
My pleasure at being 
So wet 

Here on my own 
All on my own 
How good it feels to be alone 
Tonight 

And I haven't felt so alive 
In years 

The moon 
Is shining in the sky 
Reminding me 
Of so many other nights 
When my eyes have been so red 
I've been mistaken for dead 
But not tonight"
25,Caroline's Monkey  ,"Caroline knows how fragile we are
With hope as our faith
We look to the stars
Caroline's monkey is crying again
There's no satisfaction
On Caroline's train

Caroline leaks through holes in her skin
Her promise of sweetness
Forgiveness and everything
Caroline's monkey coos in her ear
Drives like a demon
Through Caroline's tears

Caroline feels the ice in her veins
The minutes and hours
The naming of days
Caroline said her dreams never end
For Caroline's monkey
And Caroline's friends

Fading's better than failing
Falling's better than feeling
Folding's better than losing
Fixing's better than healing
Sometimes

Caroline's monkey claws at her back
Colder than winter
Darker than black
Caroline's monkey is hungry again
Running with scissors
On needles and pins

Caroline's monkey lives where she lays
Sleeps like a thief
And steals through the days
Caroline's monkey makes up all the fun
Leaves chaos and ruin
On Caroline's tongue

Caroline knows how fragile we are
With hope as our faith
We look to the stars
Caroline's monkey is crying again
There's no satisfaction
On Caroline's train

Fading's better than failing
Falling's better than feeling
Folding's better than losing
Fixing's better than healing
Sometimes"
26,Clean ,"Clean
The cleanest I've been 
An end to the tears 
And the in-between years 
And the troubles I've seen 

Now that I'm clean 
You know what I mean 

I've broken my fall 
Put an end to it all 
I've changed my routine 
Now I'm clean 

I don't understand 
What destiny's planned 
I'm starting to grasp 
What is in my own hands 

I don't claim to know 
Where my holiness goes 
I just know that I like 
What is starting to show 

Sometimes 

Clean 
The cleanest I've been 
An end to the tears 
And the in-between years 
And the troubles I've seen 

Now that I'm clean 
You know what I mean 

I've broken my fall 
Put an end to it all 
I've changed my routine 
Now I'm clean 

As years go by 
All the feelings inside 
Twist and they turn 
As they ride with the tide 

I don't advise 
And I don't criticise 
I just know what I like 
With my own eyes 

Sometimes 

Clean 
The cleanest I've been 
An end to the tears 
And the in-between years 
And the troubles I've seen 

Now that I'm clean 

Sometimes

You know what I mean 

I've broken my fall 
Put an end to it all 
I've changed my routine 
Now I'm clean 

Sometimes

Now that I'm clean 
The cleanest I've been"
27,Comatose ,"Comatose, almost 
You've got me dreaming 
Slipping in 
And Sliding out 
Of conscious feeling 

Take a light 
Start the flame 
Play the game 
I am lost 
In your eyes 
Hypnotised 
Here I believe 
Dreams never deceive 

Comatose, almost 
You've got me dreaming 
Slipping in 
And sliding out 
Life has no meaning 

Bodies move 
Colours change 
Girl you're strange 
Here inside 
I'm at home 
I'm alive 

Don't be afraid 
I'm floating away 

Comatose, almost 
You've got me dreaming 
Slipping in 
And sliding out 
Of conscious feeling 

Comatose, almost 

Comatose, almost 

Comatose"
28,Come Back ,"Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting, patiently
Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting here patiently

Walking a thin white line, between love and hate
Wasting all of my time, in another world
In another place
I could use a little company
A little kindness could go a long way

Weeks turn into months
Months turn into years
Reaching the same conclusions
Gathering up the fear

Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting, patiently
Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting here patiently

Light will always shine in the heart of you
In truth and in reality
Only blindness can hide it away
I could use a little restraint
A little kindness can go a long way

Weeks turn into months
Months turn into years
Reaching the same conclusions
Gathering up the fear
Living the same delusion
Gathering of the fear

Come back"
29,Coming Back To You ,"Maybe I'm still hurting I can't turn the other cheek but you know that I still love you 
It's just that I can't speak I looked for you in everyone and they called me on that too 
I lived alone but I was only coming back to you they're shutting down the factory now just 
When all the bills are due and the fields they're under lock and key 
Though the rain and the sun come through and springtime starts and then it stops in the name of 
Something new and all my senses rise against this coming back to you and they're handing down my 
Sentence now and I know what I must do another mile of silence while I'm coming back to you there are 
Many in your life and many still to be Since you are a shing light there's many that you'll see but 
I have to deal with envy when you choose the precious few who've left their pride on the other side of 
Coming back to you even in your arms I know I'll ever get it right even when you bend to give me comfort 
In the night I've got to have your word on this or none of it is true and all I've said is just instead of 
Coming back to you"
30,Condemnation ,"Condemnation
Tried 
Here on the stand 
With the book in my hand 
And truth on my side 

Accusations 
Lies 
Hand me my sentence 
I'll show no repentance 
I'll suffer with pride 

If for honesty 
You want apologies 
I don't sympathize 
If for kindness 
You substitute blindness 
Please open your eyes 

Condemnation 
Why 
Because my duty 
Was always to beauty 
And that was my crime 

Feel elation 
High 
To know I can trust this 
Fix of injustice 
Time after time 

If you see purity 
As immaturity 
Well it's no surprise 
If for kindness 
You substitute blindness 
Please open your eyes"
31,Corrupt ,"I could corrupt you
In a heartbeat
You think you're so special
Think you're so sweet
What are you trying
Don't even tempt me
Soon you'll be crying
And wishing you'd dreamt me

You'll be calling out my name
When you need someone to blame

I could corrupt you
It would be easy
Watching you suffer
Girl, it would please me
But I wouldn't touch you
With my little finger
I know it would crush you
My memory would linger

You'd be crying out in pain
Begging me to play my games

I could corrupt you
It would be ugly
They could sedate you
But what good would drugs be
But I wouldn't touch you
Put my hands on your hips
It would be too much to
Place my lips on your lips

You'd be calling out my names
Begging me to play my games"
32,Cover Me ,"I've felt better
I've been up all night
I can feel it coming
The morning light

The air is so cold here
It's so hard to breathe
We better take cover
Will you cover me?

Way up here with the Northern lights
Beyond you and me
I dreamt of us in another life
One we've never reached

And you know we're sinking
We could fade away
I'm not going down
Not today

The air is so cold here
Too cold to see
We have to take cover
Cover me

Way up here with the Northern lights
Beyond this broken bars
I pictured us in another life
Where we're all super stars"
33,Damaged People ,"We’re damaged people 
Drawn together 
By subtleties that we are not aware of 
Disturbed souls 
Playing out forever 
These games that we once thought we would be scared of 

When you’re in my arms 
The world makes sense 
There is no pretence 
And you’re crying 
When you’re by my side 
There is no defence 
I forget to sense I’m dying 

We’re damaged people 
Praying for something 
That doesn’t come from somewhere deep inside us 
Depraved souls 
Trusting in the one thing 
The one thing that this life has not denied us 

When I feel the warmth of your very soul 
I forget I’m cold 
And crying 
When your lips touch mine 
And I lose control 
I forget I’m old 
And dying"
34,Dangerous ,"The things you do
Aren't good for my health
The moves you make
You make for yourself
The means you use

They're the one's that I would choose

I wouldn't want it any other way
You wouldn't let me any way

Dangerous
The way you leave me wanting more
Dangerous
That's what I want you for
Dangerous

The lies you tell
Aren't meant to deceive

For me to believe

Your vicious words
You know by now
It takes alot to see me hurt

I couldn't take it any other way
But there's a price I have to pay

Will I take my rest
Among the blessed?

Mother are you waiting?
Father are you pacing?
I'm coming home

I'm knocking on Death's door
Will I take my rest
In my sunday best?

Mother are you anxious?

I've been away too long
For so long it was strong
I've been away too long

Said do you feel it when you cut me
Said do you feel it when you cut me

There's a fire

It was just a dreaming"
37,Don't say you love me ,"You'll be the killer
I'll be the corpse
You'll be the thriller
And I'll be the drama, of course

If you play the sinner
I'll play the stain
If you play the winner
I'll be your permanent pain

I'll be the boredom
You, the desire
I'll be the catcalls
And you'll be the sound of the choir

You, anesthetic
I'll be the scream
You'll be the promise
And I'll be the end of your dreams

So don't say you love me
'Cause you'll never love me

You'll be the flowers
That some lover sent
I'll be the goodbye
Note that is hiding in them

You are the singer
I am the song
The tune that will linger
The bitter taste left on your tongue

So don't say you love me
How could you love me?

Your flowers and the make-believe
The secrets and the notes you keep
The promises left on the sheets
You'll never love me
Fool your friends, believe your lies
Make amends and alibis
In the end you can't disguise
That you'll never love me

You'll be the killer
I'll be the corpse
You'll be the laughter
And I'll be the punchline, of course"
38,Down In The Boondocks ,"Down in the boondocks,

people put me down,
‘cause that’s the side of town
I was born in
I love her, she loves me,
but I don’t fit in her society
lord have mercy on a boy from
down in the boondocks

Every night I watch the lights
from the house upon the hill
I love a little girl who lives up there
and I guess I always will
but I don’t dare knock upon her door,
‘cause her daddy is my boss man
so I got to try to be content,
to see her whenever I can goin’

Down in boondocks,

One fine day I’ll find a way
to move from this old shack
I’ll hold my head up like a king
and I never will look back
until that day I’ll work and slave,
and I’ll save every dime
but tonight she’ll have to steal away
to see me one more time,
goin

39,Dream on ,"Can you feel a little love?

As your bony fingers close around me 
Long and spindly 
Death becomes me 
Heaven, can you see what I see?

Hey you pale and sickly child 
You're death and living reconciled 
Been walking home a crooked mile 

Paying debt to karma 
You party for a living 
What you take won't kill you 
But careful what you're giving 
Mmm

There's no time for hesitating 
Pain is ready, pain is waiting 
Primed to do it's educating 

Unwanted, uninvited kin 
It creeps beneath your crawling skin 
It lives without, it lives within' you 

Feel the fever coming 
You're shaking and twitching 
You can scratch all over 
But that won't stop you itching 

Can you feel a little love?
Can you feel a little love?

Dream on, dream on 

Mmm, mmm, mmm
Blame it on your karmic curse
Oh, shame upon the universe
It knows, it's lines
It's well rehearsed

It sucked you in, it dragged you down
To where there is no hallowed ground
Where holiness is never found

Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're giving

Can you feel a little love?
Can you feel a little love?

Dream on, dream on

Can you feel a little love?
Can you feel a little love?

Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on"
40,Dreaming Of Me ,"Light switch
Man switch 
Film was broken only then 
All the night
Views tomorrow 
Dancing with a distant friend 

Filming and screening 
I picture 
The scene 
Filming and dreaming 
Dreaming of me, yeah

And so we left 
Understanding 
Clean cuts on the sounding past 
Talked of sad
I talked of war 
I laughed and climbed the rising cast 

Filming and screening 
I picture 
The scene 
Filming and dreaming 
Dreaming of me, yeah

Quickly 
I remembered
Fused and saw a face before
Timing reason
Understanding
Like association hall

Filming and screening

The scene 
Filming and dreaming 
Dreaming of me, yeah

Dreaming of me 
Just dreaming of me 
It's only me 
Just me"
41,Dressed In Black ,"She is dressed in black again 
And I'm falling down again 
Down to the floor again 
I'm begging for more again 
But oh, what can you do 
When she's dressed in black 

My mind wanders endlessly 
On paths where she's leading me 
With games that she likes to play 
And words that she doesn't say 
Not when we're alone 
And she's dressed in black 

As a picture of herself 
She's a picture of the world 
A reflection of you 
A reflection of me 
And it's all there to see 
If you only give in 
To the fire within 

Dressed in black again (x4)

Shadows fall onto me 
And she stands there over me 
And waits to encompass me 
I lay here helplessly 
But oh, what can you do 
When she's dressed in black 

Dressed in black again (x8)"
42,Enjoy the Silence ,"Words like violence 
Break the silence 
Come crashing in 
Into my little world 
Painful to me 
Pierce right through me 
Can't you understand?
Oh, my little girl 

All I ever wanted 
All I ever needed 
Is here in my arms 
Words are very unnecessary 
They can only do harm 

Vows are spoken 
To be broken 
Feelings are intense 
Words are trivial 
Pleasures remain 
So does the pain 
Words are meaningless 
And forgettable

All I ever wanted 
All I ever needed 
Is here in my arms 
Words are very unnecessary 
They can only do harm 

All I ever wanted 
All I ever needed 
Is here in my arms 
Words are very unnecessary 
They can only do harm 

All I ever wanted 
All I ever needed 
Is here in my arms 
Words are very unnecessary 
They can only do harm

I will protect you
And surround you with my love
As well as any man can
As well as any man could

I will be there for you
Always
And when the black clouds rises
And the radiation falls
I will look you in the eye
And kiss you
And give you all my love
As well as any man can
As well as any man could

You are my eternal
Eternal

44,Everything Counts ,"The handshake 
seals the contract 
From the contract 
there's no turning back 
The turning point of a career 
In Korea being insincere 
The holiday was fun-packed 
The contract, still intact 

The grabbing hands 
grab all they can 
All for themselves - after all 

It's a competitive world 
Everything counts in large amounts 

The graph on the wall 
Tells the story of it all 
Picture it now see just how 
The lies and deceit gained
a little more power 
Confidence - taken in 
By a sun tan and a grin 

The grabbing hands 
grab all they can 
All for themselves - after all
The grabbing hands 
grab all they can 
All for themselves - after all
It's a competitive world

Everything counts
in large amounts

The grabbing hands 
Grab all they can 
Everything counts

45,Fail ,"People, do we call this trying?
We're hopeless, forget the denying
Our souls are corrupt
Our minds are messed up
Our consciences, bankrupt
Oh, we’re fucked

People, what are we thinking?
It's shameful, our standards are sinking
We're barely hanging on
Our spirit has gone
And once where it shone
I hear a lonesome song

People, how are we coping?
It's futile to even to even start hoping
That justice will prevail
That truth will tip the scales
Our dignity has sailed
Oh, we've failed"
46,Flexible ,"Fame 
Can have strange effects 
Money 
Can have strange effects 

I ask myself 
Is it a sin 
To be flexible 
When the boat comes in 

Open the window and out go ideas 

Drink 
Can alter you 
Girls 
Can have strange effects, too 

We all know boats don't last 
We all know cars are fast"

There are flies on the windscreen

Waiting to die 
And I can sense 
The hours slipping by 
Tonight 

Come here 
Kiss me 
Now 
Come here 
Kiss me 
Now 

Death is everywhere 
The more I look 
The more I see 
The more I feel 
A sense of urgency

48,Fools ,"Don't know the reason why I 
Think I've been here before 
This place seems so familiar 
But then I can't be sure 
Here comes that time again when 
You'll walk right out the door 
Don't tell me secrets anymore 

And fools don't run away 
You'll be followed another day 
And all the chances that fall your way 
Are in the fire on your dying day 
So call me now and tell me that you're home 

Can't see the sense in crying 
There's too many tears to fall 
My thoughts are multiplying 
So I'll try to save them all"
49,Fragile Tension ,"There's a fragile tension
That's keeping us going
It may not last forever
But oh when it's flowing

There's something magical in the air
something so tragic we have to care

There's a strange obsession
That's drawing us nearer
We don't understand it
It never gets clearer

There's something mystical in our genes
So simplistic it kicks and screams

Oh when we're teetering
On the edge of collapse
Nothing can keep us down

There's dizzying feeling
That's keeping us flying
Through glittering galas
Without even trying

There's something radical in our hands
Nothing logical to our plans"
50,Free ,"I will never be free 
I shall never be released 
From the chains that bind me 
That torture and blind me 
And keep me from peace 

Oh what heartache 
Oh what heartbreak 
Following me 
Calling to me 

I will never be free 
I shall never be released 
From the chains that bind me 
That torture and blind me 
And keep me from peace 

I will never be free 
I will never be laid to rest 
Sisters and brothers 
I'll never recover 
From this tenderness 

See what love brings 
Hear what love sings 
Sad melodies 
Enticing me"

I can feel your desperation 
Emotional deprivation

Let your feelings show 

Picking up the conversations 
Deep in your imagination 
Tune into the lonely voices 
Talking of their only choices 

Let yourself go 
Let yourself go 
Let your spirit grow 

Step out of your cage 
And onto the stage 
It's time to start 
Playing your part 
Freedom awaits 
Open the gates 
Open your mind 
Freedom's a state 

I can taste the tears falling 
The bitterness inside you calling 
Yearning for a liberation 
Emotional emancipation 

Let yourself go 
Let yourself go 
Let your senses overflow 

Step out of your cage 
And onto the stage 
It's time to start 
Playing your part 
Freedom awaits 
Open the gates 
Open your mind 
Freedom's a state"
53,Get Right With Me ,"I will have faith in man 
That is hard to understand 
Show some humility 
You have the ability 
Get right with me 

Friends, if you've lost your way 
You will find it again some day 
Come down from your pedestals 
And open your mouths that's all 
Get right with me 

Life is such a short thing 
That I cannot comprehend 
But if this life were a bought thing 
There are ways I know we'd mend 

People, take my advice 
Already told you once, once or twice 
Don't waste your energy 
Making apologies 
Get right with me"
54,Get The Balance Right ,"There's more besides the joyrides 
A little house in the country-side 
Understand, learn to demand 
Compromise but sometimes lie. 

Get the balance right 
Get the balance right 

Be responsible, respectable 
Stable but gullibe 
Concerned and caring, help the helpless 
But always remain ultimately selfish 

Get the balance right 
Get the balance right 

When you think you've got a hold of it all 
You haven't got a hold at all 
When you reach the top get ready to drop 
Prepare yourself for the fall 
Your're gonna fall 
It's almost predictable

Don't tend this way, don't tend that way 
Straight down the middle until next Thursday 
First to left, back to right 
Twist and turn 'till you`ve got it right"
55,Ghost ,"I'm the ghost in your house
And calling your name
My memory lingers
You'll never be the same
I'm the hole in your heart
I'm the stain in your bed
The phantom in your fingers
The voices in your head

One touch is all it took
To draw you in
To leave you hooked
One kiss, you paid the price
You had a taste of paradise

Now you running in circles
Chasing imaginary footsteps
Reaching for shadows
In the bed where I once slept

I'm the ghost in your house
And calling your name
My memory lingers
You'll never be the same
I'm the hole in your heart
I'm the stain in your bed
The phantom in your fingers
The voices in your head

One thought is all it takes
You lose control
You make mistakes
This pain will never leave
Until I die, you'll always grieve

And now you're falling to pieces
Seeing my face wherever you go
Talking to strangers
From a place they'll never know

I'm the ghost in your house
And calling your name
My memory lingers
You'll never be the same
I'm the hole in your heart
I'm the stain in your bed
The phantom in your fingers
The voices in your head

The voices in your head
The voices in your head
The voices in your head"
56,Ghosts Again ,"Wasted feelings
Broken meanings
Time is fleeting
See what it brings

Hellos, goodbyes, a thousand midnights
Lost in sleepless lullabies

Heaven's dreaming
Thoughtless thoughts, my friends
We know we'll be ghosts again

Sundays shining
Silver linings
Weightless hours
All my flowers

A place to hide the tears that you cried
Everybody says goodbye

Faith is sleeping
Lovers in the end
Whisper we'll be ghosts again

Heaven's dreaming
Thoughtless thoughts, my friends
We know we'll be ghosts again

Faith is sleeping
Lovers in the end
Whisper we'll be ghosts again"
57,Going Backwards ,"We are not there yet
We have not evolved
We have no respect
We have lost control
We're going backwards
Ignoring the realities
Going backwards
Are you counting all the casualties?

We are not there yet
Where we need to be
We are still in debt
To our insanities
We're going backwards
Turning back our history
Going backwards
Piling on the misery

We can track in all the satellites
See it all in plain sight
Watch men die in real time
But we have nothing inside
We feel nothing inside

We are not there yet
We have lost our soul
The course has been set
We're digging our own hole
We're going backwards
Armed with new technology
Going backwards
To a cavemen mentality

We can emulate on consoles
Killings we can control
For senses that have been dulled
Because there's nothing inside
We feel nothing inside

We feel nothing inside
(We feel nothing, nothing inside)
We feel nothing inside
(We feel nothing, nothing inside)
We feel nothing inside
(We feel nothing, nothing inside)
We feel nothing inside
(We feel nothing, nothing inside)
We feel nothing inside
(We feel nothing, nothing inside)
Because there's nothing inside
Because there's nothing inside"
58,Goodbye ,"It was you that took my soul,
 threw it in the fire,
 tamed it in the rapture,
 filled me with desire,
 Now, I'm pure,
 Now, I'm clean,
 I feel cured and serene in you.

 There is no denying,
 How I have been changed,
 You won't hear me crying,
 Now, misery is strange,
 I can dream,
 I can fly,
 Now, it seems I get by with you.

 goodbye pain
 goodbye again.

 I was always looking,
 Looking for someone,
 Someone to stick my hook in,
 pull it out and run
 Now, I'm caught on your line,
 All my thoughts are entwined in you.

 goodbye pain
 goodbye again.

 If you see me walking,
 To the golden gates,
  turn around start talking,
 Stop and hesitate,
 I'll be waiting up there,
 With my fate in the air,
 For you.

59,Goodnight Lovers ,"Here, somewhere in the heart of me 
There is still a part of me 
That cares 

And I'll, I'll still take the best you've got 
Even though I'm sure it's not 
The best for me 

When you're born a lover 
You're born to suffer 
Like all soul sisters 
And soul brothers 

I, I can see the danger signs 
They only help to underline 
Your beauty 

I'm not looking for an easy ride 
True happiness cannot be tried 
So easily 

When you're born a lover 
You're born to suffer 
Like all soul sisters 
And soul brothers 

Like all soul sisters 
And soul brothers 

You can take your time 
I'll be waiting in line 
You don't even have to give me 
The time of day 

When you're born a lover 
You're born to suffer 
Like all soul sisters 
And soul brothers 

Like all soul sisters 
And soul brothers"
60,Halo ,"You wear guilt 
Like shackles on your feet 
Like a halo in reverse 

I can feel 
The discomfort in your seat 
And in your head it's worse 

There's a pain 
A famine in your heart 
An aching to be free 

Can't you see 
All love's luxuries 
Are here for you and me 

And when our worlds they fall apart 
When the walls come tumbling in 
Though we may deserve it 
It will be worth it 

Bring your chains 
Your lips of tragedy 
And fall into my arms 

And when our worlds they fall apart 
When the walls come tumbling in 
Though we may deserve it 
It will be worth it."
61,Happens All The Time ,"No need to feel ashamed
There's nothing to be gained
When your dreams are in the past
Like stars we crush and burn
Only to return
Life goes by so fast

So who is left to blame
Nothing's quite the same
We can't live in the past
I'm burning as hot as the sun
And I've only just began
 love, it fades so fast

Sometimes I forget
All I will regret
When I leave this world behind
 sometimes I'm not sure
What I'm fighting for
It happens all the time

I know I've had enough
Maybe far too much
It's easy to be blind
When it's just me and you
I know what I have to do
I can leave this world behind

No need to feel ashamed
There's nothing to be gained
When your dreams are in the past
Like stars, we crash and burn
Only to return
Times they change so fast

Sometimes I forget
All I will regret
When I leave this world behind
Sometimes I'm not sure
What I'm fighting for
It happens all the time
It happens all the time
It happens all the time"

Happiest girl I ever knew 

Wanted to feel the joy 
Pass between our eyes 
Wanted to feel the joy 
Pass between our thighs 

And I would have to pinch her 
Just to see if she was real 
Just to watch the smile fade away 
And see the pain she'd feel 

Wanted to feel her joy 
Feel it deep within 
Wanted to feel her joy 
Penetrate my skin 

Happiest girl I ever knew 
Why do you smile the smile you do"
63,Heaven ,"Sometimes I slide away 
Silently 
I slowly lose myself 
Over and over 

Take comfort in my skin 
Endlessly 
Surrender to my will 
Forever and ever 

I dissolve in trust 
I will sing with joy 
I will end up dust 
I’m in heaven 

I stand in golden rays 
Radiantly 
I burn a fire of love 
Over and over 

Reflecting endless light 
Relentlessly 
I have embraced the flame 
Forever and ever 

I will scream the word
Jump into the void
I will guide the herd
Up to Heaven"
64,Here Is The House ,"Here is the house 
Where it all happens 
Those tender moments 
Under this roof 
Body and soul come together 
As we come closer together 
And as it happens 
It happens here 
In this house 

And I feel your warmth 
And it feels like home 
And ther'es someone 
Calling on the telephone 
Let's stay home 
It's cold outside 
And I have so much 
To confide to you 

With or without words 
I'll confide everything 

Here is the house 
Where it all happens 
Those tender moments 
Under this roof 
Body and soul come together 
As we come closer together 
And as it happens 
It happens here 
In this house 

So we stay at home 
And I'm by your side 
And you know 
What's going on inside 
Inside my heart 
Inside this house 
And I just want to 
Let it out for you  

And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home

Here is the house
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together"
65,Heroes ,"I, I will be king
And you, you will be my queen
Though nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, for ever and ever
We can be heroes, just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is the fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day

I, well I wish I could swim
Like the dolphins, like the dolphins can swim
Oh nothing, will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, for ever and ever
What d'you say?

And I, I will be king
And you, will be my queen
Oh nothing can keep us together
We can beat them, for ever and ever
We can be heroes, just for one day

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, it fell on the other side
We can beat them, for ever and ever
We can be heroes, just for one day
What d'you say?

We can be heroes 
Just for one day
We can be heroes 

Oh nothing will keep us together
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
We can be heroes, just for one day

Oh-oh-oh-ohh (we can be heroes)
Oh-oh-oh-ohh (just for one day)
Oh-oh-oh-ohh (just for one day)"
66,Higher Love ,"I can taste more than feel 
This burning inside is so real 
I can almost lay my hands upon 
The warm glow that lingers on 

Moved, lifted higher 
Moved, my soul's on fire 
Moved, by a higher love 
I surrender all control 
To the desire that consumes me whole 
Leads me by the hand to infinity 
Lies in wait at the heart of me 

Moved, lifted higher 
Moved, my soul's on fire 
Moved, by a higher love 
By a higher love

Heaven bound on the wings of love 
There's so much that you can rise above 

Moved, lifted higher 
Moved, moved, by a higher love 
By a higher love 

I surrender heart and soul 
Sacrificed to a higher goal 

Moved, moved by a higher love 
By a higher love"
67,Hole To Feed ,"We are here 
We can love 
We share something 
I'm sure that you mean the world to me 

Your name was the one 
That was always chosen 
Your words and their kindness 
Have set me free 

Shame has a hold 
That's kept us frozen 
You opened my eyes to a world 
That I could believe 

Words can leave you 
Broken inside 
You’ll have to decide 
I'm hanging on to my pride 

We are here 
We can love 
We share something 
I'm sure that you mean the world to me 
When you get what you need 
There's no way of knowing 
What you'll have
Is another hole to feed 

The games that were played 
Have left us hoping
The gift that we have - the life
That we breathe

This world can leave you 
Broken inside
With nowhere to hide 
I'm hanging  on to my pride

We are here 
We've been chosen 
We've been blessed with a place 
We need to find and then open

We are here
We can love
We share something
I'm sure that you mean the world to me
When you get what you need 
There's no way of knowing
What you'll have
Is another hole to feed"
68,Home ,"Here is a song 
From the wrong side of town 
Where I'm bound 
To the ground 
By the loneliest sound 
That pounds from within 
And is pinning me down 

Here is a page 
From the emptiest stage 
A cage or the heaviest cross ever made 
A gauge of the deadliest trap ever laid 

And I thank you 
For bringing me here 
For showing me home 
For singing these tears 
Finally I've found 
That I belong here 

The heat and the sickliest 
Sweet smelling sheets 
That cling to the backs of my knees 
And my feet 
But I'm drowning in time 
To a desperate beat 

And I thank you 
For bringing me here 
For showing me home 
For singing these tears 
Finally I've found 
That I belong 

Feels like home 
I should have known 
From my first breath 

God send the only true friend 
I call mine 
Pretend that I'll make amends 
The next time 
Befriend the glorious end of the line 

And I thank you 
For bringing me here 
For showing me home 
For singing these tears 
Finally I've found 
That I belong here"
69,I Am You ,"You have bound my heart with subtle chains 
So much pleasure that it feels like pain 
So entwined now that we can't shake free 
I am you and you are me

No escaping from the mess we're in 
So much pleasure that it must be sin 
I must live with this reality 
I am yours eternally 

There's no turning back 
We're in this trap 
No denying the facts 
No, no, no 
No excuses to give 
I'm the one you're with 
We've no alternative 
No, no, no 

Dark obsession in the name of love 
This addiction that we're both part of 
Leads us deeper into mystery 
Keeps us craving endlessly 

Strange compulsions that I can't control 
Pure possession of my heart and soul 
I must live with this reality 

I am you and you are me 
I am you and you are me 
I am you and you are me 
I am you and you are me 

There's no turning back 
We're in this trap 
No denying the facts 
No, no, no 
No excuses to give 
I'm the one you're with 
We've no alternative 
No, no, no"
70,I Feel Loved ,"It's the dark night of my soul 
And temptation's taking hold 
But through the pain and the suffering 
Through the heartache and trembling 

I feel loved 
I feel loved 

As the darkness closes in 
In my head I hear whispering 
Questioning and beckoning 
But I'm not taken in 

I feel loved 
I feel loved 

From the depths of my emptiness 
Comes a feeling of inner bliss 
I feel wanted, I feel desired 
I can feel my soul on fire 

I feel loved 
I feel loved"
71,I Feel No Guilt ,"Who am I to say to you
That we will stay together
Who am I to say to you
That we won't last forever
I feel no guilt over indulgent pleasures
I see no call for any drastic measures

Even if you say to me
That we should never wander
Let distance infect me
Make our love grow stronger
I don't understand all these cut-throat conventions
And I see no point in undue complication

I feel no guilt over indulgent pleasures
I see no call for any drastic measures
I don't understand all these cut-throat conventions
And I see no point in undue complication
I feel no guilt over indulgent pleasures
I see no call for any drastic measures
I don't understand all these cut-throat convention
And I see no point in undue complication"

Your sun it shines
I feel you
Within' my mind

You take me there
You take me where
The kingdom comes
You take me to
And lead me through
Babylon

This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love

I feel you
Your heart it sings
I feel you
The joy it brings

Where heaven waits
Those golden gates
And back again
You take me to
And lead me through
Oblivion

This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love

I feel you
Your precious soul
And I am whole
I feel you
Your rising sun
My kingdom comes

I feel you
Each move you make
I feel you
Each breath you take

Where angels sing
And spread their wings
My love's on high
You take me home
To glory's throne
By and by

This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love
This is the morning of our love
It's just the dawning of our love"
73,I Like It ,"I like it, I like it
I like the way you run your
fingers through my hair
And I love the way you tickle my chin
And I like the way you let
yourself in when your mommy's
not there
I like it, I like it
I like the things you say and
all the things you do
And I like the way you straighten my tie
And I like the way you're winking your eye
And I know I like you
And I know I like you

Do that again
You're driving me insane
Kiss me once more
That's another thing I like you for

Are you liking it too?"
74,I Love You Love Me Love ,"We're still together
After all that we've been through
They tried to tell you I was not the boy for you
They didn't like my hair
The clothes I loved to wear
They didn't even know that I was strong enough for two

I Love you Love
You Love me too Love
I Love you Love me Love
I Love you Love
My only true Love
I Love you Love me Love

The things they said about the two of us were lies
I knew they couldn't see
The love lights in your eyes
They said I wouldn't dare
To show how much I care
They didn't know that we were just two angels in disguise

I Love you Love
You Love me too Love
I Love you Love me Love
I Love you Love
My only true Love
I Love you Love me Love

So here we are alone
We made it on our own
And though they tried
They can't deny the way I really showed them

You Love me too Love
I Love you Love me Love
I Love you Love
My only true Love
I Love you Love me Love

I Love you Love
You Love me too Love

76,I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead ,"New sound all around 
You can hear it too 
I'm getting hot never stop 
Just for me and you 
Playing on my radio 
And saying that you had to go 

New day turn away 
Wipe away the tear 
A new night feel alright 
Knowing that you're here 
Dancing with you all the time 
And don't you think that it's a crime? 

Back street never meet 
Never say goodbye (never say goodbye) 
I know where to go 
But I don't know why 
You say that it's from above 
And I say this is modern love"
77,I Want It All ,"I see a river 
It’s oceans that I want 
You have to give me everything 
Everything’s not enough 

It’s my desire 
To give myself to you 
Sometimes 

Sometimes I try 
Sometimes I lie, with you 
Sometimes I cry 
Sometimes I die, it’s true 
Somewhere I find something that’s kind in you

And I’ve crossed the line again 
A line I drew in sand 
And still you give me everything 
But everything’s not enough 

I’m ready but not willing 
To give myself to you 
Sometimes 

Come on over lay down beside me 
And I’ll try 
Come on over lay down beside me 
And I’ll try 
And I’ll try 

I want it all"
78,I Want You Now ,"I want you now
Tomorrow won't do
There's a yearning inside
And it's showing through
Reach out your hands
And accept my love
We've waited for too long
Enough is enough
I want you now

My heart is aching
My body is burning
My hands are shaking
My head is turning
You understand
It's so easy to choose
We've got time to kill
We've got nothing to lose
I want you now

And I don't mean to sound
like one of the boys
That's not what I'm trying to do
I don't want to be
Like one of the boys
I just want you now

'Cause I've got a love
A love that won't wait
A love that is growing
And it's getting late
Do you know what it means
To be left this way
When everyone's gone
And the feelings they stay
I want you now"
79,Ice Machine ,"Running through my head secretly 
The shouts of the boys in the factory 
I ring you on the telephone silently 
Like blood, like wine in the darkroom scene 

The darkroom scene
Darkroom scene 

A letter
Once composed 
Seven years long and as tall as a tree 
Reading 
On the wall 
Emissions
Efficiency 

Efficiency
Efficiency 

Resurrect
As a feeling
On my window
Of a past reunion

Resurrect as a feeling
On my window
Of a past reunion
Vision of a picture
Like the city
And the air we breathe

The air we breathe
Air we breathes

She stood beside me once again 
I knew her face 
We met before 
In the street 
Recalling all the children dancing at our feet

The dancing feet
Dancing feet"
80,If You Want ,"Working week's come to it's end 
Party time is here again 
Everyone can come if they want to 
If you want to be with me 
If you want to be with me 
You can come with me if you want to 

Exercise your basic right 
We could build a building site 
From the bricks of shame is built the hope 
If you want to be with me 
If you want to be with me 
Even though you may still not want to 

Let tomorrow and today 
Bring a life of ecstasy 
Wipe away your tears of confusion 
If you want to be with me 
If you want to be with me 
You can come with me if you want to 
Even though you may still not want to"
81,In chains ,"The way you move
Has got me yearning
The way you move
Has left me burning

I know, you know what you're doing to me
I know, my hands will never be free
I know, what it's like to be in chains

The way you move
Is meant to haunt me
The way you move
To tempt and taunt me

I know, you knew on the day you were born
I know somehow I should've been warned
I know, I walk every midnight to dawn in chains

In chains
I'm in chains
In chains
I'm in chains

You've got me dying for you
It's you that I'm living through
You've got me praying to you
Saying to you anything you want me to

You've got me reaching for you
My soul's beseeching me too
You've got me singing to you
Bringing to you anything you ask me to

The way you move
Is mesmerizing
The way you move
Is hypnotizing

I know, I crumble when you are around
Stutter, mumble a pitiful sound
Stagger, stumble shackled and bound in chains

In chains
I'm in chains
In chains
I'm in chains

You've got me dying for you
It's you that I'm living through
You've got me praying to you
Saying to you anything you want me to

You've got me reaching for you
My soul's beseeching me too
You've got me singing to you

82,In Sympathy ,"They're almost falling over you
Why don't they call a truce
Whatever they are trying to do
It's of little use

They're drowning you in compliments
Trying to furnish proof
And though they speak with eloquence
There is little truth

You're bright, you're strong
You know your right from wrong
At least to some degree
You're wise, you're tough
You've heard their lies enough
You smile in sympathy

I'm watching your serenity
The way your so transcends
Their tedious obscenities
Your patience never ends

And as the night begins to fade
You're heading for the door
Followed by a sad parade
You're on your own once more

You're bright, you're strong
You know your right from wrong
At least to some degree
You're wise, you're tough
You've heard their lies enough
You smile in sympathy"
83,In Your Memory ,"Put up the barriers shut down your senses 
Cover up with all of your pretences 
See no evil, your eyes are blunted 
We are the hunters, we are the hunted 

Place it in your memory 
Leave it in your past 
But don't forget 

Taking a tumble, I'm taking a dive 
Sometimes I stumble when my mind's made up 
Reaction levels seem strangely muted 
Ordinary acts of fun have been diluted 

Place it in your memory 
Leave it in your past 
But don't forget"
84,In Your Room ,"In your room 
Where time stands still 
Or moves at your will 
Will you let the morning come soon 
Or will you leave me lying here 
In your favourite darkness 
Your favourite half-light 
Your favourite consciousness 
Your favourite slave 

In your room 
Where souls disappear 
Only you exist here 
Will you lead me to your armchair 
Or leave me lying here 
Your favourite innocence 
Your favourite prize 
Your favourite smile 
Your favourite slave 

I'm hanging on your words 
living on your breath 
feeling with your skin 
Will I always be here 

In your room 
Your burning eyes 
Cause flames to arise 
Will you let the fire die down soon 
Or will I always be here 
Your favourite passion 
Your favourite game 
Your favourite mirror 
Your favourite slave 

I'm hanging on your words 
living on your breath 
feeling with your skin 
Will I always be here"
85,Insight ,"This is an insight 
Into my life 
This is a strange flight 
I'm taking 
My true will 
Carries me along 

This is a soul dance 
Embracing me 
This is the first chance 
To put things right 
Moving on 
Guided by the light 

And the spirit of love 
Is rising within me 
Talking to you now 
Telling you clearly 
The fire still burns 

Wisdom of ages 
Rush over me 
Heighten my senses 
Enlighten me 
Lead me on 
Eternally 

And the spirit of love 
Is rising within me 
Talking to you now 
Telling you clearly 
The fire still burns 

And the spirit of love 
Is rising within me 
Talking to you now 
Telling you clearly 
The fire still burns 

I'm talking to you now 
The fire still burns 
Whatever you do now 
The world still turns

I'm talking to you now 
The fire still burns 
Whatever you do now 
The world still turns

I'm talking to you now"
86,It Doesn't Matter ,"I am happy 
That I have you 
Even though you're not here now 
I know somewhere 
You are dreaming 
Though it's definitely not of me 

It doesn't matter 
If this all shatters 
Nothing lasts forever 
But I'm praying 
That we're staying 
Together 

I am warmed 
By your friendship 
Even when you're far away 
And I'm happy 
In the knowledge 
We may never see the day 

When I kiss you 
And you kiss me 
Don't pretend you miss me 
The worst kind 
Of diseased mind 
Is one filled with jealousy 

If we should meet again 
Don't try to solve the puzzle 
Just lay down next to me 
And please don't move a muscle 

I will thank you 
Most of all for 
The respect you have for me 
I'm embarrassed 
It overwhelms me 
Because I don't deserve any"
87,It Doesn't Matter Two ,"As I lay here with you
The shame lies with us
We talk of love and trust
That doesn't matter

Though we may be the last in the world
We feel like pioneers
Telling hopes and fears
To one another

And oh what a feeling
Inside of me
It might last for an hour
Wounds aren't healing
Inside of me
Though it feels good now
I know it's only for now

The feeling is intense
You grip me with your eyes
And then I realise
It doesn't matter"
88,It's Called A Heart ,"There's something beating here inside my body
And it's called a heart
You know how easy it is
To tear it apart
If I lend it to you
Will you keep it safe for me
I'll lend it to you
If you treat it tenderly
There's something beating here inside my body
And it's called a heart

There's a sun shining in the sky
But that's not the reason why
I'm feeling warm inside
The answer isn't classified, it's my heart
From the moment I started
I tried to be goodhearted
Yes I tried my best
And more or less
I spoke from my heart

There's a lot to be learnt
And you learn when you heart gets burnt

Hearts could never be owned
Hearts only come on loan
If I want it back
I will take it back, I'll take my heart
But I will try my best and more or less
I will speak from my heart
Yes I will speak from my heart
Speak from my heart"
89,It's No Good ,"I'm going to take my time 
I have all the time in the world 
To make you mine 
It is written in the stars above 
The gods decree 
You'll be right here by my side 
Right next to me 
You can run, but you cannot hide 

Don't say you want me 
Don't say you need me 
Don't say you love me 
It's understood 
Don't say you're happy 
Out there without me 
I know you can't be 
'Cause it's no good 

I'll be fine 
I'll be waiting patiently 
'Till you see the signs 
And come running to my open arms 
When will you realise 
Do we have to wait 'till our worlds collide 
Open up your eyes 
You can't turn back the tide 

Don't say you want me 
Don't say you need me 
Don't say you love me 
It's understood 
Don't say you're happy 
Out there without me 
I know you can't be 
'Cause it's no good 

I'm going to take my time 
I have all the time in the world 
To make you mine 
It is written in the stars above"
90,Jezebel ,"They call you Jezebel
Whenever we walk in
you're going straight to hell
For wanted acts of sin - they say, 
and that I'll have to pay
But I need you just this way

They call you Jezebel
For what you like to wear
You're morally unwell
They say you never care for me
But what they fail to see is that your games are the key

Open their eyes to the beauty
Open their hearts to the fun
Open their minds to the idea that you don't own someone

They call you Jezebel
Whenever men walk by
They say that they can tell
The longing in your eyes is real
and how you really feel
But they can't see your appeal

Jezebel"

Put him in an elevator 
Take him up to the highest high
Take him up to the top
Where the mountains stop

He's a smooth operator
It's time we cut him down to size
Take him by the hand
And put him on the stand
Let us hear his alibis

From the Israelites
Stealing a God
From the Muslim too

He should bow his head in shame

By and by (x4)
John The Revelator! (x3)"
92,Judas ,"Is simplicity best 
Or simply the easiest 
The narrowest path 
Is always the holiest 
So walk on barefoot for me 
Suffer some misery 
If you want my love 
If you want my love 

Man will survive 
The harshest conditions 
And stay alive 
Through difficult decisions 
So make up your mind for me 
Walk the line for me 
If you want my love 
If you want my love 

Idle talk 
And hollow promises 
Cheating Judases 
Doubting Thomases 
Don't just stand there and shout it 
Do something about it 

You can fulfill 
Your wildest ambitions 
And I'm sure you will 
Lose your inhibitions 
So open yourself for me 
Risk your health for me 
If you want my love 
If you want my love 
If you want my love 
If you want ym love"
93,Just Can't Get Enough ,"When I'm with you baby 
I go out of my head 
And I just can't get enough 
And I just can't get enough 

All the things you do to me 
And everything you said 
I just can't get enough 
I just can't get enough 

We slip and slide as we fall in love 
And I just can't seem to get enough, ah

We walk together 
We're walking down the street 
And I just can't get enough 
And I just can't get enough 

Every time I think of you 
I know we have to meet 
I just can't get enough 
I just can't get enough 

It's getting harder it's a burning love 
And I just can't seem to get enough, ah 

I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

And when it rains 
You're shining down for me 
And I just can't get enough 
And I just can't get enough 

Just like a rainbow 
You know you set me free 
And I just can't get enough 
And I just can't get enough 

You're like an angel and you give me your love 
And I just can't seem to get enough, ah

94,Leave in silence ,"I've told myself so many times before
But this time I think I mean it for sure
We have reached a full stop
Nothings gonna save us from the big drop

Reached our natural conclusion
Outlived the illusion
I hate being in these situations
That call for diplomatic relations

If I only knew the answer
Or I thought we had a chance
Or I could stop this
I would stop this thing from spreading like a cancer

What can I say? (I don't want to play) anymore
What can I say? I'm heading for the door
I cant stand this emotional violence
Leave in silence
Leave in silence

We've been running around in circles all year
Doing this and that and getting nowhere
This'll be the last time
I think I said that last time

If I only had a potion
Some magical lotion
That could stop this, I would stop this
I would set the wheels in motion

What can I say? (I don't want to play) anymore
What can I say? I'm heading for the door
I can't stand this emotional violence
Leave in silence
Leave in silence

Leave in silence
Leave in silence"
95,Let's Get Together ,"Come on everybody, won’t you gather around now
Listen what I am trying to say
Let’s all get together, come and hold my hand now
Listen the beginning starts today

Let’s get together, aaah
Let’s get right now, yeah
Don’t want to cry no more
Like you did before
Maybe we can make it somehow

People of the world will come on learn the language
Singing to a special song
You can learn it too, just got to give some love and
Listen baby won't take long

Let’s get together, aaah
Let’s get right now, yeah
Don’t want to cry no more
Like you did before
Maybe we can make it somehow

Sunshine from a bright new day
Turning the emotions, for a different dance now
Listen to me what I say

Let’s get together, aaah
Let’s get right now, yeah
Don’t want to cry no more
Like you did before
Maybe we can make it somehow"
96,Lie To Me ,"Come on and lay with me 
Come on and lie to me 
Tell me you love me 
Say I'm the only one 

Experiences have a lasting impression 
But words once spoken 
Don't mean a lot now 
Belief is the way 
The way of the innocent 
And when I say innocent 
I should say naive 
So lie to me 
But do it with sincerity 
Make me listen 
Just for a minute 
Make me think 
There's some truth in it 

Promises made for convenience 
Aren't necessarily 
What we need 
Truth is a word 
That's lost its meaning 
The truth has become 
Merely half-truth 
So lie to me 
Like they do it in the factory 
Make me think 
That at the end of the day 
Some great reward 
Will be coming my way"
97,Light ,"Take my hand
And walk in the light
Understand, there's a fire to ignite
You know we have a responsibility
It's true we've been chosen
And now we have the possibility
Of melting what's frozen

Walk with me with the rapture inside
Can't you see it's not our place to decide
You know we have to make a case for love
It's more of a duty
It's clear we have a mission from above
A mission of beauty

You know I wouldn't lie to you
What would I achieve by that
It's more than I would try to do
These are the facts

Take your place here
With love in your heart
Just embrace what you've known from the start
We are fulfilling our only destiny
The angels have spoken
And all the gods in the universe agree
The spell can't be broken"
98,Lilian ,"Oh, Lillian
Look what you've done
You've stripped my heart
Ripped it apart
In the name of fun

Oh, Lillian
I'm a poor man's son
And precious jewels
Weren't found in schools
Where I came from

Pain and misery always hit the spot
Knowing you can't lose what you haven't got

Oh, Lillian
I should have run
I should have known
Each dress you own
Is a loaded gun

Oh, Lillian

Oh, Lillian
I need protection
I hear your voice
And any choice I had is gone

Oh, Lillian
Once I begun
I couldn't stop
'til every drop of blood was sung

Pain and misery always hit the spot
Knowing you can't lose what you haven't got

Oh, Lillian
Look what you've done
You stripped my heart
Ripped it apart
In the name of fun

Oh, Lillian
Oh, Lillian
Oh, Lillian
Oh, Lillian"
99,Little 15 ,"Little 15
You help her forget 
The world outside 
You're not part of it yet 
And if you could drive 
You could drive her away 
To a happier place 
To a happier day 
That exists in your mind 
And in your smile 
She could escape there 
Just for a while 
Little 15 

Little 15 
Why take the smooth with the rough 
When things run smooth 
It's already more than enough 
She knows your mind 
Is not yet in league 
With the rest of the world 
And it's little intrigues 
Do you understand 
Do you know what she means 
As time goes by 
And when you've seen what she's seen 
You will 
Little 15 

Little 15 
Why does she have to defend 
Her feelings inside 
Why pretend 
She's not had a life 
A life of near misses 
Now all that she wants 
Is 3 little wishes 
She wants to see with your eyes 
She wants to smile with your smile 
She wants a nice surprise 
Every once in a while

Is going to shine
Shine out so bright
And illuminate your mind
My little soul will leave a footprint

This little voice
Is going to sing
I have no choice
It will infinitely ring
My little soul will leave a footprint

I'm channelling the universe
That's focusing itself
Inside of me
A singularity

My little words
Are going to sting
Haven't you heard
The pain and joy they bring
My little soul will leave a footprint

I'm channelling the universe

I can't disguise
The beauty inside me

101,Long Time Lie ,"It's been a while since you did something
Not so long since you complained
You sit around here doing nothing
Every day

You're the coward who points the finger
I understand that I'm helping you
You have delusions in some spaced-out fantasy
That's what you do

He loves to wallow in the glory
 Loves to cut you down to size
 Try to make you believe in all of his lies

It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time
A long time lie

Don't you ever look in the mirror
Don't you know there's so much more
Locked up inside that box
Behind your door

All your twisted conversations
When you're sitting all alone
Just remember we know your secret
While you moan

He loves to wallow in the glory
loves to cut you down to size
Try to make you believe
In all of his lies

It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time
A long time lie"
102,"Love, In Itself ","All of these insurmountable tasks 
That lay before me 
All of the firsts and the definite lasts 
That lay in store for me 

There was a time 
When all on my mind was love 
Now I find that most of the time 
Love's not enough 
In itself 

Consequently 
I've a tendency 
To be unhappy
You see 
The thoughts in my head 
All the words that were said 
All the blues and the reds 
Get to me 

There was a time 
When all on my mind was love 
Now I find that most of the time 
Love's not enough 
In itself 

All of these absurdities 
That lay before us 
All of the doubts 
And the certainties 
That lay in store for us

There was a time 
When all on my mind was love 
Now I find that most of the time 
Love's not enough 
In itself"

Heightened awareness 
I hear my blood flow 
I feel its caress 

Whispering cosmos 
Talking right to me 
Unlimited endless 
God breathing through me 

See the microcosm 
In macro vision 
Our bodies moving 
With pure precision 
One universal celebration 
One evolution 
One creation 

Thundering rhythm 
Pounding within me 
Driving me onwards 
Forcing me to see 
Clear and enlightening 
Right there before me 
Brilliantly shining 
Intricate beauty 

See the microcosm 
In macro vision 
Our bodies moving 
With pure precision 
One universal 
Celebration 
One evolution 
One creation"
104,Martyr ,"I’ve been a martyr for love
And I will die in the flames
As I draw my last breath
As I’m closing on death
I will call out your name

I’ve been a martyr for love
Nailed up on the cross
While you’re having your fun
As the damage is done
I’m assesing the cost

I knew what I was letting myself in for
I knew that I could never even the score

I’ve been a martyr for love
I need to be by your side
I have knelt at your feet
I have felt your deceit
Couldn't leave if I tried

I’ve been a martyr for love
Tortured every hour
From the day I was born
I’ve been moved like a pawn
By the greatest of powers

I knew that I would have to suffer in vain
A way that I would never outgrow the pain

I’ve been a martyr for love
I’ve been a martyr for love
I’ve been a martyr for love"

It's a lot
It's a lot
It's a lot
It's a lot
It's a lot
Like life

There's a new game
We like to play you see
A game with added reality
You treat me like a dog
Get me down on my knees

We call it master and servant
We call it master and servant

It's a lot like life
This play between the sheets
With you on top
And me underneath
Forget all about equality

Let's play master and servant
Let's play master and servant

It's a lot like life
(It's a lot like life)
And that's what's appealing
If you despise that throw away feeling
(It's a lot like life)
From disposable fun
Then this is the one

Domination's the name of the game
In bed or in life
They're both just the same
Except in one you're fulfilled
At the end of the day

Let's play master and servant
Let's play master and servant

Come on
Come on
Master and servant

106,Mercy In You ,"You know what I need 
When my heart bleeds 
I suffer from greed 
A longing to feed 
On the mercy in you 

I can't conceal 
The way I'm healed 
The pleasure I feel 
When I have to deal 
With the mercy in you 

I would do it all again 
Lose my way and fall again 
Just so I could call again 
On the mercy in you 

When here in my mind 
I feel inclined 
To wrongly treat you unkind 
I have faith I will find 
The mercy in you 

I would lose my way again 
Be led hopelessly astray again 
Just so I could pray again 
For the mercy in you 

When here in my mind 
I have been blind 
Emotionally behind 
I have faith I will find 
The mercy in you"
107,Miles Away ,"It's one of those conversations
We've, we've had through before

The ones that leave you empty
And waiting for more

Your eyes they tell me something
That I understand
Your eyes they hold the truth
And the truth is:

You're miles away 3x

Excuse me for my hesitation
If I met you before
Your face seems so familiar
And belonging for more

Your eyes, they tell me something
That I understand

Your eyes, they hold the truth
And a truth is

You're miles away (3x)

With all your superstitions
And empty lines
I could be just like you
Withdrawn but alive

Life it has it's limitations, 
We all have our needs
Love could be the only answer
It lies underneath

Your eyes, they tell me something
That I understand
Your eyes they hold the truth
And the truth is

You're miles away (3x)"
108,Monument ,"When the site was found 
We laid the foundations down. 
It didn't take long before 
They came back tumbling down. 
Don't build at night 
You need a little light. 
How else yo going to see 
What it is going to be like! 
So we picked up the tools 
And we worked in the morning light, 
With the last stone placed 
Wasn't it a wonderful sight, 
But it fell back down 
And scattered all around, 
Anything passes 
When you need glasses! 

My Monument - it fell down 
My Monument - it fell down 

Work all of my days for this kind of praise, 
It fell down 
Work all of my days - it fell down."
109,More Than A Party ,"Lots of surprises in store 
This isn't a party 
It's a whole lot more 

We've had enough of this blind man's buff 
You've kept us in the dark for long enough 

This is more than a party 
More than a party 
More than a party 

Keep telling us we're to have fun 
Then take all the ice cream so we've got none 

The failed magician waves his wand 
And in an instant the laughter's gone 

Lots of surprises in store 
This isn't a party 
It's a whole lot more"

My cosmos is mine

No war, no war, no war
No more, no more, no more, no more
No fear, no fear, no fear, no fear
Not here, not here, not here, not here
No rain, no clouds
No pain, no shrouds
No final breaths
No senseless deaths

Don't stare at my soul
I swear it is fine
Its borders are outlined
My cosmos is mine
My cosmos is mine
My cosmos is mine
My cosmos is mine"
111,My Favourite Stranger ,"Some perfect stranger
Sneaks on tip-toes
Steals my shadow
And goes where I go

My favourite stranger
Stands in my mirror
Puts words in my mouth
All broke and bitter

Some perfect stranger
My imitation
Drops my name in
My conversations

Some perfect stranger
Speaks when I speak
Walks in my footsteps
And talks in my sleep

My favourite stranger
Stands where I stand
Leaves crime in my wake
And blood on my hands"

My joy... in God I believe

You move me 

I'm not a mountain, no 
You move me 

My joy... the heavenly bliss 
My joy... the pleasure I miss 
My joy... 
You move me 

I'm not a mountain, no 
You move me"
113,My Little Universe ,"(Verse)
 My little universe is expanding… slowly
 And Those who know me say I’m growing every day
 Beautiful emptiness surrounds me
 I take small steps
 I’m making progress in a non-specific  way

(Chorus)
 Here I am king
 I decide everything
 I let no one in
 No one
 No one
 No one

(Verse)
 Limited consciousness preserves me
 It protects me
 And just connects enough to keep the wolves at bay
 My little universe is expanding… slowly
And Those who know me say I’m growing every day

(Chorus)
 Here I am king
 I decide everything
 I let no one in
 No one
 No one
 No one"
114,My Secret Garden ,"My secret garden's not so secret anymore 
Run from the house holding my head in my hands 
Feeling dejected, feeling like a child might feel 

It all seems so absurd that this should have occurred 
My very only secret and I had to go and leak it 
My secret garden's not so secret anymore 

No, my secret garden's not so secret anymore 
Run through the fields down to the edge of the water 
Can't stay long, here comes the reason why 

She'll catch me if she can, take me by the hand 
I'll have to keep on running and I just can't see the fun in 
My secret garden not being secret anymore 

It used to be so easy on days such as these she'd 
Search and search for hours, in among the flowers 

I loved it, I loved her 

Play the fool, act so cruel (I loved it) 
Read a book, take a look (I loved her) 

It all seems so absurd that this should have occurred 
My very only secret and I had to go and leak it 
My secret garden's not so secret anymore"

Never want to put my feet back down on the ground

Promises me I'm safe as houses 
As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers 
I hope he never lets me down again

116,Never Let Me Go ,"I'm waiting for your love
I know you'll want me
When your body's had enough
Your senses will see
There's only so much time
We have to play with
To waste it is a crime
We have so much to give

When uncertainty parts
You'll be ready to concede
It was plain from the start
You've been running from me
And I have been patient
I have been so calm
Bit my lips through the torment
Please fall into my arms
Never let me go
Never let me go

Watch our dreams unfold in colour
Underneath love's moon we'll wander
Never let me go
Never let me go

The angels will praise us
The world will seem right
We'll pull it out of the darkness
And into the light
We will be beacons
Shining so bright
Like stars in the darkness
For lovers at night

We will be beacons
Shining so bright
Like stars in the darkness
For lovers at night

Never let me go
Never let me go"
117,Never Turn Your Back On Mother Earth ,"When she's on her best behaviour
Don't be tempted by her favours
Never turn your back on mother earth

Towns are hurled from A to B
By hands that looked so smooth to me
Never turn your back on mother earth

Grasp at straws that don't want grasping
Gaze at clouds that come down crashing
Never turn your back on mother earth

Three days and two nights away from my friends
Amen to anything that brings a quick return
To my friends
To my friends

Never turn your back on mother earth

Well I'll admit I was unfaithful
But from now I'll be more faithful
Never turn your back on mother
Never turn your back on mother
Never turn your back on mother earth"

The last time

The last time
Call it what you want
You don't mean a thing to me no more

You go your way, I'll go mine

We've climbed the mountain in so many ways
Reach the top then slowly fade away

Will slowly disappear like the falling rain

I saw you in the picture 
I saw you play the part 
This ain't nodisco 

There's a thousand watts in you 
You take this too far 
This ain't nodisco 

Sometimes when I wonder if you're taking a chance 
This ain't nodisco and you know how to dance

I’ll need a miracle to help me this time 
I heard what you said and I feel the same 
I know in my heart that I’ll have to change

Nothing’s impossible 
I still believe in love at first sight 
Nothing’s impossible 

How did we get to be this far apart? 
Let's take a chance, go back to the start

I want to be here I'm not there

125,Now This Is Fun ,"Here speaks the voice of reason 
It's talking to me loud and clearly 
And obviously, it's something to say 

Here comes another sentence 
It is relentless, it tries my patience

We can see the benefits 
So we'll ignore it or disobey it 
An dnever say that this is fun

127,One Caress ,"Well I'm down on my knees again 
And I pray to the only one 
Who has the strength 
To bear the pain 
To forgive all the things that I've done 

Oh Girl 
Lead me into your darkness 
When this world is trying it's hardest 
To leave me unimpressed 
Just one caress 
From you and I'm blessed 

When you think you've tried every road 
Every avenue 
Take one more look 
At what you found old 
And in it you'll find something new 

I'm shying from the light 
I always loved the night 
And now you offer me eternal darkness 

I have to believe that sin 
Can make a better man 
It's the mood that I am in 
That left us back where we began"

That I find myself 
I find myself 
It's only when I lose myself in someone else 
That I find myself 
I find myself 

Something beautiful is happening inside for me 
Something sensual, it's full of fire and mystery 
I feel hypnotised
I feel paralysed 
I have found heaven 

There's a thousand reasons 
Why I shouldn't spend my time with you 
For every reason not to be here
I can think of two 
To keep me hanging on 
Feeling nothing's wrong 
Inside your heaven 

It's only when I lose myself in someone else 
That I find myself 
I find myself 
It's only when I lose myself in someone else 
That I find myself 
I find myself 

I can feel the emptiness inside me 
Fade and disappear 
There's a feeling of contentment 
Now that you are here 
I feel satisfied 
I belong inside 
Your velvet heaven 

Did I need to sell my soul for pleasure like this 
Did I have to lose control to treasure your kiss 
Did I need to place my heart in the palm of your hand 
Before I could even start to understand 

It's only when I lose myself in someone else 
That I find myself 
I find myself 
It's only when I lose myself in someone else 
That I find myself
I find myself 
It's only when I lose myself in someone else

I'm leaving bitterness behind
This time I'm cleaning up my mind
There is no space for the regrets
I will remember to forget

Just look at me
I am walking love incarnate
Look at the frequencies of which I vibrate
I'm going to light up the world

Peace will come to me
Peace will come to me

I'm leaving anger in the past
With all the shadows that it cast
There is radar in my heart
I should have trusted from the start

Just look at me
I'm a living act of holiness
Giving all the positivity that I possess
I'm going to light up the world

Peace will come to me
Just wait and see
Peace will come to me
It's meant to be
Peace will come to me
Just wait and see
Peace will come to me
It's inevitability"
130,People Are Good ,"Keep telling myself
That people are good
Whisper it under my breath
So I don't forget
Keep fooling myself
That they do all they can
Sometimes they simply slip up
But it's not what they meant

Heaven help me
Heaven help me
Heaven help us
Heaven help us

Keep reminding myself
That people are good
And when they do bad things
They're just hurting inside
Keep fooling myself
That everyone cares
And they're all full of love
It's just their patience gets tried

Heaven help me
Heaven help me
Heaven help us
Heaven help us

Everything will be alright in time
It will be fine

'Cause people are good

People are people 
So why should it be 
You and I should get along so awfully 

So we’re different colours 
And we’re different creeds 
And different people 
Have different needs 
It’s obvious you hate me 
Though I’ve done nothing wrong 
I’ve never even met you 
So what could I have done 

I can’t understand 
What makes a man 
Hate another man 
Help me understand

And you’re kicking 
And you’re shouting at me 
And I’m relying on your common decency 
So far it hasn’t surfaced 
But I’m sure it exists 
It just takes a while to travel 
From your head to your fist (head to your fists) 

I can’t understand 
What makes a man 
Hate another man 
Help me understand 

People are people 
So why should it be 
You and I should get along so awfully 
People are people

132,Perfect ,"On another world by another star 
At another place and time 
In another state of consciousness
In another state of mind 

Everything was almost perfect
Everything fell into place, 
The jury reached a different verdict, 
Before the judge dismissed the case 

In a parallel universe
That's happening right now 
Things between us must be worse 
But it's hard to see just how 

And everything could have been perfect 
Everything in the right place 
Then I wouldn't have to play the suspect 
Accused, abandoned and disgraced 

I didn't shoot, I didn't pull the trigger 
It wasn't me, I'm just a plain and simple singer 
I heard the sound, I turned my head around 
To watch our love shot down 

In another lonely universe
We're laying side by side 
Where no one's hurt and no one's cursed
And no one needs to hide 

And everything is almost perfect 
Everything is almost right 
There are never any conflicts 
There are never any fights"

Should have hidden it, shouldn't you 
Now you're not satisfied 
With what you're being put through 
It's just time to pay the price 
For not listening to advice 
And deciding in your youth 
On the policy of truth 

Things could be so different now 
It used to be so civilised 
You will always wonder how 
It could have been if you'd only lied 
It's too late to change events 
It's time to face the consequence 
For delivering the proof 
In the policy of truth 

Never again is what you swore 
The time before 
Never again is what you swore 
The time before 

Now you're standing there tongue tied 
You'd better learn your lesson well 
Hide what you have to hide 
And tell what you have to tell 
You'll see your problems multiplied 
If you continually decide 
To faithfully pursue 
The policy of truth 

Never again is what you swore 
The time before 
Never again is what you swore 
The time before"

Pushing alone with heavy load
Heading for no fix abode
Shovelling slow

Corporations get the breaks
Keeping almost everything they make
Tell us just how long it's going to take
For it to trickle down
When will it trickle down

Hey, he's down the street
Lying in the snow and sleet
Begging for something to eat
And looking beat

Hey, passers-by
They don't care to catch his eye
Couldn't even tell you why
Of what's happening inside

But words left unspoken 
Left us so brittle 
There was so little left to give 

Angels with silver wings 
Shouldn’t know suffering 
I wish I could take the pain for you
If God has a master plan 
That only He understands 
I hope it’s your eyes He’s seeing through 

Things get damaged
Things get broken 
I thought we’d managed 
But words left unspoken 
Left us so brittle 
There was so little left to give 

I pray you’ll learn to trust 
Have faith in both of us

I come up to meet you 
Up there somewhere 
When I rush to greet you 
My soul is bared 

Gave more for you 
Dropped my crutches

Went looking behind every door for you

I spiritually grew

Driven to this point by a chain of events, 
Each one pushed me nearer the edge. 
Going to send my message through to you, 
You'll receive the signal too 
I will function, operate, 
I will be a satellite of hate. 

Higher, Higher 

Disillusioned - I was disenchanted, 
Forgot the love that had been implanted, 
Heard the lies and I felt the cold, 
It broke my heart and I lost control- 
Now I'm in a satellite of a free state, 
I'm a satellite of hate."

You're feeling what I am feeling too 
The final chapter in the contract expires soon
We've come to the end

Thank God I'm not the same as you
You've always known exactly what to do
It's who I am, it's not like you 
We've come to the end

Did I disappoint you? 
I wanted to believe it's true
The book of love was not enough 
To see us through 

The problem 
Should have been you(Should have been you)
Should have been you(Could have been you)
Should have been you(Would have been you)
(Should have been you,Would have been yo
If it hadn't been me
(would have been you,could have been you)
Should have been you(should have been you)
Should have been you(would have been you)
(Should have been you)
If it hadn't been me"
153,See you ,"All I want to do is see you again 
Is that too much to ask for? 
I just want to see your sweet smile 
Smiled the way it was before 

Well I'll try not to hold you 
And I'll try not to kiss you 
And I won't even touch you 

All I want to do is see you 
Don't you know that it's true 

I remember the days when we'd walk through the woods 
And sit on a bench for a while 
I treasure the way we used to laugh and play 
And look in each others eyes 

You can keep me at a distance if you don't trust my resistance 
But I swear I won't touch you 

All I want to do is see you 
Don't you know that it's true 

Well I know five years is a long time 
And that times change (oh that times change) 
But I think that you will find 
People are basically the same (basically the same) 

If the water's still flowing, we can go for a swim 
And do the things we used to do 
And if I'm reluctant you can pull me in 
And we can relive our youth 

Oh but we'll stay friendly like sister and brother 
Though I think I still love you 
All I want to do is see you 
Don't you know that it's true?"
154,Set Me Free (Remotivate Me) ,"Set me free 
Set me free 

Remotivate me 
Set me burning 
After years in deep freeze 
My body is yearning 
For a new lease of life 
And a little spice 
Set me free 
Remotivate me 

Give me a reason 
To scream and shout 
Give me something 
To get excited about 
When everything is looking dull 
I'm sure it isn't impossible to 
Set me free 
Remotivate me 

Remotivate me 
Set me burning 
After years in deep freeze 
My body is yearning 
For a new lease of life 
And a little spice 
Set me free 
Remotivate me 

Don't think I'm impatient 
Because I'm willing to wait 
But something must must happen 
Before it gets too late 
It could be my imagination 
But wasn't there more than this dull sensation 
Set me free 
Remotivate me"
155,Shake The Disease ,"I'm not going down on my knees,
Begging you to adore me.
Can't you see it's misery
And torture for me.

When I'm misunderstood try as hard as you can,
I've tried as hard as I could.
To make you see,
How important it is for me.

Ref.: (2x)
Here is a plea from my heart to you,
Nobody knows me as well as you do.
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease,
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these.

(4x)
Understand me

Some people have to be,
Permanently together.
Lovers devoted to each,
Other forever.

Now I've got things to do and I've said before,
That I know you have too.
When I'm not there,
In spirit I'll be there.

Ref.:
Here is a plea from my heart to you,
Nobody knows me as well as you do.
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease,
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these.

156,Shame ,"Do you ever get that feeling 
When the guilt begins to hurt? 
Seeing all the children 
Wallowing in dirt 
Crying out with hunger 
Crying out in pain 
At least the dirt will wash off 
When it starts to rain 

Soap won't wash away your shame 

Do you ever get the feeling 
That something isn't right? 
Seeing your brother's fist 
Clenched ready for the fight 
Soon the fighting turns to weapons 
And the weapons turn to wounds 
So the doctor's stitch and stitch and stitch 
And stitch and stitch and stitch and stitch 

Surgery won't improve your pain 

It all seems so stupid 
It makes me want to give up 
But why should I give up 
When it all seems so stupid? 

Do you ever get the feeling 
That something can't be done? 
To eradicate these problems 
And make the people one 
Do you ever get that feeling 
Something like a nagging itch? 
And all the while the doctors stitch 
And stitch and stitch and stitch and stitch 

Hope alone won't remove the stains (for shame) 

It all seems so stupid 
It makes me want to give up 
But why should I give up 
When it all seems so stupid?"
157,Shine ,"Put on your blindfold 
And a dress that's tight 
And come with me 
On a mystery night 
Open your eyes 

Follow our stars under a painted sky 
We'll leave the world behind 
We're learning to fly 
We used to get by 

Forget the pictures on your TV screen 
We'll steal the visions 
That you keep for your dreams 
You can turn me on 

I was blind and I saw the light 
My angel coming 
In a brilliant white 
Shine for me 

You've been hanging from a rope of mediocrity 
Strung up by your insecurities 
You can shine for me 
Somebody has to 
Shine for me 
It's difficult not to 
Shine for me 

Follow our stars under a painted sky 
We'll leave the world behind 
We're learning to fly 
We used to get by 

Forget the pictures on your TV screen 
We'll steal the visions 
That you keep for your dreams 
You can turn me on 

You've been hanging from a rope of mediocrity 
Strung up by your insecurities 
You can shine for me 
Somebody has to 
Shine for me 
It's difficult not to 
Shine for me 
Somebody has to 
Shine for me 
It's difficult not to 
Shine for me"
158,Should Be Higher ,"I dream of a day
when I dare to believe
you're the answer

When the shame
and the guilt are removed
and the truth appears

Of the touch of your hand
I lose who I am
if I want to

I try to resist but
succumb to the bliss
of your kiss

You should be higher
I'll take you higher
 don't be afraid
You'll just have to pray

Your lies are more attractive
than the truth
Love is all I want
Your lies are written down there
in your book
Love is all I want

Your arms are infected
they're holding the truth
Oh stop all your crying
this one you'll lose

You should be higher
I'll take you higher
 don't be afraid
You'll just have to pray

Your lies are more attractive
than the truth
Love is all I want
Your lies are written down there
in your book
Love is all I want

You should be higher (2x)

159,Shouldn't Have Done That ,"Plans made in the nursery 
Can change the course of history 
Remember that 

Mommy's annoyed 
Says go and play 
Don't show your face 
Stay away all day 
Shouldn't have done that 

Small boy and his infantry 
Marching around so naturally 
Shouldn't have done that 

Grows up and goes to school 
Such a nice boy, obeys all the rules 
Mummy's proud of that 

Leaves school 
To follow his ambition 
Knows what he wants 
To be a politician 
Shouldn't have done that"
160,Shout ,"She was silent trying to be 
Like the girl who acted on the TV 
Always knowing when to say 
Wishing for a moment so that they could see 

Staring in the night 
Picture in my room 
And I think that she knew her lines 

Break away tonight 
I wanna hold your hand 
We've got to get it right 
We've got to understand 

Carefully watching waiting as I 
Stood upon the back streets and we start to play 
I was screaming louder as the 
Curtains fall between us in a twisted way 

Staring in the night 
Picture in my room 
And I think that she knew her lines 

Break away tonight 
I wanna hold your hand 
We've got to get it right 
We've got to understand 

Placing all the questions in the minutes of a game
We won so long ago
Dangerous and beautiful the radio transmission
That I have to know

You could never run 
You could never stay 
And I think you belong to me 

Break away tonight 
I wanna hold your hand 
We've got to get it right 
We've got to understand 

Break away tonight 
I wanna hold your hand 
We've got to get it right 
We've got to understand"
161,Sister Of Night ,"Sister of night 
When the hunger descends 
And your body's a fire 
An inferno that never ends 
An eternal flame 
That burns in desire's name 

Sister of night 
When the longing returns 
Giving voice to the flame 
Calling you through flesh that burns 
Breaking down your will 
To move in for the kill 

Oh sister, come for me 
Embrace me, assure me 
Hey sister, I feel it too 
Sweet sister, just feel me 
I'm trembling, you heal me 
Hey sister, I feel it too 

Sister of night 
In your saddest dress 
As you walk through the light 
You're desperate to impress 
So you slide to the floor 
Feeling insecure 

Sister of night 
With the loneliest eyes 
Tell yourself it's alright 
He'll make such a perfect prize 
But the cold light of day 
Will give the game away 

Oh sister, come for me 
Embrace me, assure me 
Hey sister, I feel it too 
Sweet sister, just feel me 
I'm trembling, you heal me 
Hey sister, I feel it too"
162,Slow ,"Slow, slow
As slow as you can go
So I can feel all I want to know
Slow, slow
I'll go with your flow

Let the world keep its carnival pace
I prefer to look into your beautiful face
What a waste
Let the starts continue to fly by
I don’t have one desire to understand why
I don’t try

Slow, slow
As slow as you can go
I want my sense to overflow
Slow, slow
And doesn’t it show

I don’t need a race in my bed
When speed’s in my heart
And speed’s in my head instead
It’s tempting for fools to rush in
When something’s so good
Why should we rush a thing
It’s a sin

Slow, slow
As slow as you can go
That’s how I like it
I like it

I don’t need a race in my bed
When speed’s in my heart
And speed’s in my head instead

Slow, slow
As slow as you can go
That’s how I like it
I like it"
163,So Cruel (U2 Cover) ,"We crossed the line
 Who pushed who over
 It doesn't matter to you
 It matters to me

 We're cut adrift
 We're still floating
 I'm only hanging on
 To watch you go down
 My love

 I disappeared in you
 You disappeared from me
 I gave you everything you ever wanted
 It wasn't what you wanted

 The men who love you, you hate the most
 They pass through you like a ghost
 They look for you but your spirit is in the air
 Baby, you're nowhere

 Oh...love...you say in love there are no rules
 Oh...love...sweetheart...
 You're so cruel

 Desparation is a tender trap
 It gets you every time
 You put your lips to her lips
 To stop the lie

 Her skin is pale like God's only dove
 Screams like an angel for your love
 Then she makes you watch her from above
 And you need her like a drug

 Oh...love...you say in love there are no rules
 Oh...love...sweetheart...
 You're so cruel

 She wears my love like a see-through dress
 Her lips say one thing
 Her movements something else
 Oh love...like a screaming flower
 Love...dying every hour...love

 You don't know if it's fear or desire
 Danger the drug that takes you higher
 Head in heaven, fingers in the mire

 Her heart is racing, you can't keep up
 The night is bleeding like a cut
 Between the horses of love and lust
 We are trampled underfoot

 Oh...love...you say in love there are no rules
 Oh...love...sweetheart...
 You're so cruel

 Oh...love...to stay with you I'd be a fool
 Sweetheart...you're so cruel"
164,So Much Love ,"I can't lie
I can't fake
I can't act
My hands shake
This disclosure
I must make
There is so much love in me

I can't run
I have tried
There's a thorn
in my side
There is something
I can't hide
There is so much love in me

You can forsake me
Try to break me
But you can't shake me
No
You can despise me
Demonise me
It satisfies me
So

There's a fire
In my veins
The desire
causes pain
I will say it
Again
There is so much love in me

You can forsake me
Try to break me
But you can't shake me
No
You can despise me
Demonise me
It satisfies me so

There is so much love in me"

Have I got soft touch
Is my radar that off
Is my radar that off

I'm thinking
if you're sinking
then I'll drown
I've got a confession 
 your depression
will take me down

Am I on the right track
Am I on the right track
Have I picked a bad time
Have I picked a bad time

It's seening
that you're dreaming through
 my eyes
Why protest
when your success
is my prize

Oh brother
Give me a helping hand
Oh brother
Tell me you understand

Have I hit a raw nerve
Have I hit a raw nerve
Have I got a soft touch

166,Somebody ,"I want somebody to share 
Share the rest of my life 
Share my innermost thoughts 
Know my intimate details 
Someone who'll stand by my side 
And give me support 
And in return 
She'll get my support 
She will listen to me 
When I want to speak 
About the world we live in 
And life in general 
Though my views may be wrong 
They may even be perverted 
She'll hear me out 
And won't easily be converted 
To my way of thinking 
In fact she'll often disagree 
But at the end of it all 
She will understand me 
Aaaahhhhh.... 

I want somebody who cares 
For me passionately 
With every thought and 
With every breath 
Someone who'll help me see things 
In a different light 
All the things I detest 
I will almost like 
I don't want to be tied 
To anyone's strings 
I'm carefully trying to steer clear of 
Those things 
But when I'm asleep 
I want somebody 
Who will put their arms around me 
And kiss me tenderly 
Though things like this 
Make me sick 
In a case like this 
I'll get away with it 
Aaaahhhhh...."
167,Something To Do ,"My little girl 
Won't you come with me 
Come with me 
And tell me 

Is there something to do 

I'm going crazy with boredom 
Come with me 
Tell me 

Grey sky over a black town 
I can feel depression 
All around 
You've got your leather boots on 

I can't stand another drink 
It's surprising this town 
Doesn't sink 
You've got your leather boots on 

Your pretty dress is oil stained 
From working too hard 
For too little 
You've got your leather boots on 

You're feeling the boredom too 
I'd gladly go with you 
I'd put your leather boots on 
I'd put your pretty dress on"
168,Sometimes ,"Sometimes 
Only sometimes 
I question everything 
And I'm the first to admit 
If you catch me in a mood like this 
I can be tiring 
Even embarrassing 

But you must 
Feel the same 
When you look around 
You can't tell me honestly 
You're happy with what you see 
Oh sometimes 
Only sometimes 

You must be 
You must be 
As embarrassing as me 
Sometimes"
169,Song for Europe ,"Here as I sit at this empty cafe thinking of you
I remember all those moments lost in wonder that we'll never find again 
Though the world is my oyster it's only a shell full of memories
Here by the Seine, Notre-Dame casts a long lonely shadow 
Now - only sorrow - no tomorrow
There's no today for us nothing is there for us to share, but yesterday 
These is my sight
These cities may change but there always remains my obsession 
Through silken waters my gondola glides and the bridge - it sights
I remember all those moments lost in wonder that we'll never find again 
There's no more time for us, nothing is there for us to share, but yesterday

Only one way to soothe my soul
Only one way (only one way) /4x

Leaving my problems
And the world's disasters
I'm heading for the open sky

I see the beauty
As the leaves start falling
Follow the light
Towards the voices calling
I'm going where the angels fly

And I'm taking my soul with me
And I'm taking my soul with me

I'm ready for the final pages
Kiss goodbye to all my earthly cages
I'm climbing up the golden stairs
Go sing it from the highest tower
From the morning
Till the midnight hour
I'm going where there are no cares

And I'm taking my soul with me
And I'm taking my soul with me"

I heard you call my name
Lying, on the bathroom floor
No one here to blame
There's a message I know can be found
I'm listening, I hear you, your sound

Speak to me, in a language
That I can understand
Tell me, that you're listening
Give me some kind of plan
Give me something, you'd be my drug of choice
You lead me, I follow, your voice

I will disappoint you
I will let you down
I need to know
You're here with me
Turn it all around
It'd be grateful, I'd follow you around
I'm listening, I'm here now, I'm found"
173,Stories Of Old ,"Take a look at unselected cases 
You'll find love has been wrecked 
By both sides compromising 
Amounting to a disastrous effect

Of princes bold 
With riches untold 
Happy souls 
Casting it all aside 
To take some bride 
To have the girl of their dreams 
At their side 
But not me 
I couldn't do that 
Not me 
I'm not like that 

I couldn't sacrifice 
Anything at all 
To love 

I really like you 
I'm attracted to you 
The way you move 
The things you do 
I'll probably burn in hell 
For saying this 
But I'm really in heaven 
Whenever we kiss 
But Oh no! 
You won't change me 
You can try 
For an eternity 

I wouldn't sacrifice 
Anything at all 
To love 

Take a look at unselected cases
You'll find love has been wrecked
By both sides compromising
Amount to a disastrous effect

Now I've got things to do 
You have too 
And I've got to be me 
You've got to be you 
So take my hand 
And feel these lips 
And let's savor a kiss

Of vintage wine 
One more time

To this love divine

I'm always willing to learn 
When you've got something to teach 
Oh, and I'll make it all worthwhile

Shackled like an animal 
Chained to my desires

And break my brittle heart 
Easily and elegantly 
Tear my world apart

Rapture, rushing through my veins 
Passion, flaming, in my heart 
Heavenly surrender once again, yeah 

We're living in a world full of illusion

To call my own 
The slightest correction 
Couldn't finely hone 
The sweetest infection 
Of body and mind 
Sweetest injection 
Of any kind 

I stop and I stare too much 
Afraid that I care too much 
And I hardly dare to touch 
For fear that the spell may be broken 

When I need a drug in me 
And it brings out the thug in me 
Feel something tugging me 
Then I want the real thing not tokens 

The sweetest perfection... 

Things you'd expect to be 
Having effect on me 
Pass undetectedly 
But everyone knows what has got me 

Takes me completely 
Touches so sweetly 
Reaches so deeply 
I know that nothing can stop me 

Sweetest perfection 
An offer was made 
An assorted collection 
But I wouldn't trade 

The sweetest perfection... 

Takes me completely 
Touches so sweetly 
Reaches so deeply 
Nothing can stop me"

Something we will never understand 
It's a hidden law 
The apple falls 
Destiny calls 
I follow you 

Like a pawn on the eternal board 
Who's never quite sure what he's moved towards 
I walk blindly on 

And heaven is in front of me 
Your heaven beckons me enticingly 
When I arrive it's gone 
The river flows 
The wise man knows 
I follow you 

I'm yearning I'm burning 
I feel love's wheels turning 

Like a moth on love's bright light 
I will get burned each and every night 
I'm dying to 
The sun will shine 
The bottom line 
I follow you 

I'm yearning I'm burning 
I feel love's wheels turning 

Like a moth on love's bright light 
I will get burned each and every night 
I'm dying to(o) 
The sun will shine 
The bottom line 
I follow you 

The sun will shine 
The bottom line 
I follow you"
181,The Child Inside ,"There is darkness and death in your eyes
 What have you got buried inside?
 The shallow grave in your soul
 The ghosts there have taken control

You really should have dug a little deeper there
 Body parts are starting to appear and scare the child inside away

Each tear that flows down your face
 Trickles then picks up the pace
 And turns to a river inside
 A river that will not subside

I can hear that dreadful overflowing sound
 And watching from afar I see a child is drowned
 The child inside your heart

I can see you drifting away
 Heading for the light
 I can see you drifting away
 Every night

Why were you always inside?
 On days when the weather was fine
 And while we were running around
 You were nowhere to be found

You know you should have taken all your dolls to bed
 But you were made to play games with your soul instead
 The child inside you died"
182,The Darkest Star ,"Oh you sad one 
Playing the angel 
Isn’t so easy where you’re from 

Oh you wild one 
Devil’s companion 
You won’t stay satisfied for long 

I don’t want you to change anything you do 
I don’t want you to be something else for me 

Oh you dark one 
Eternal outsider 
Caught in the spider’s web you’ve spun 

Oh you blind one 
Gentle and kind one 
Seeing the world as a loaded gun 

I don’t want you to change anything you do 
I don’t want you to be someone else for me 

Stay as you are the darkest star 
Shining for me 
Majestically"
183,The Dead Of Night ,"We're the horniest boys 
With the corniest ploys 
Who take the easiest girls 
To our sleaziest worlds 

With our lecherous plans 
In our treacherous hands 
You'd be wasting your time 
Saying no, it's a crime 

All that we live for you'll regret 
All you remember we'll forget 

We are the dead of night 
We're in the zombie room 
We're twilight's parasites 
With self-inflicted wounds 

We are the dead of night 
We're in the zombie room 
Heavenly oversights 
Eating from silver spoons 

With our decadent minds 
And our innocent lines 
You'll be playing our games 
With your bodies in flames 

When delirious fun 
Has seriously begun 
You'll be down on your knees 
You'll be begging us please 

All we're demanding you'll supply 
All we're accused of we'll deny 

We are the dead of night 
We're in the zombie room 
We're twilight's parasites 
With self-inflicted wounds 

We are the dead of night 
We're in the zombie room 
Heavenly oversights 
Eating from silver spoons"
184,The Landscape Is Changing ,"The landscape is changing, the landscape is crying 
Thousand of acres of forest are dying 
Carbon copies from the hills above the forestline 
Acid streams are flowing ill across the countryside 

'Cause I don't care if you're going nowhere 
Just take good care of the world 
I don't care if you're going nowhere 
Just take good care of the world 

Now we're rearranging there's no use denying 
Mountains and valleys can't you hear them sighing? 
Evolution, the solution, almost certainty 
Can you imagine this intrusion of their privacy? 

'Cause I don't care if you're going nowhere 
Just take good care of the world 
I don't care if you're going nowhere 
Just take good care of the world 

Token gestures, some semblance of intelligence 
Can we be blamed for the security of ignorance 

'Cause I don't care if you're going nowhere 
Just take good care of the world 
I don't care if you're going nowhere 
Just take good care of the world"
185,The Love Thieves ,"Oh the tears that you weep 
For the poor tortured souls 
Who fall at your feet 
With their love begging bowls 

All the clerks and the tailors 
The sharks and the sailors 
All good at their trades 
They'll always be failures 

Alms for the poor 
For the wretched disciples 
And the love that they swore 
With their hearts on the bible 

Beseeching the honor 
To sit at your table 
And feast on your holiness 
As long as they're able 

Love needs its martyrs 
Needs its sacrifices 
They live for your beauty 
And pay for their vices 

Love will be the death of 
My lonely soul brothers 
But their spirit shall live on in 
The hearts of all lovers 

Your holding court 
With your lips and your smile 
Your body's a halo 
Their minds are on trial 

Sure as adam is eve 
Sure as jonah turned whaler 
They're crooked love thieves
And you are their jailor 

Love needs its martyrs 
Needs its sacrifices 
They live for your beauty 
And pay for their vices 

Love will be the death of 
My lonely soul brothers 
But their spirit shall live on in 
The hearts of all lovers

Love will be the death of 
My lonely soul brothers 
But their spirit shall live on in 
The hearts of all lovers"
186,The Meaning Of Love ,"I've read more than a hundred books 
Seen love mentioned many thousand times 
But despite all the places I've looked 
It's still no clearer it's just not enough 
I'm still no nearer the meaning of love 

Noted down all my observations 
Spent an evening watching television 
Still I couldn't say with precision 
Know it's a feeling and it comes from above 
But what's the meaning, the meaning of love? 

The meaning of love 
Tell me the meaning of love 

From the notes that I've made so far 
Love seems something like wanting a scar 
But I could be wrong, I'm just not sure you see, 
I've never been in love before 

Next I asked several friends of mine 
If they could spare a few minutes of their time 
Their look suggested that I'd lost my mind 
Tell me the answer, my Lord high above 
Tell me the meaning, the meaning of love 

The meaning of love 
Tell me the meaning of love 

From the notes that I've made so far 
Love seems something like wanting a scar 
But I could be wrong, I'm just not sure you see, 
I've never been in love before 

Tell me the meaning of love"
187,The Price of love ,"Wine is sweet and gin is bitter 
Drink all you can but you won’t forget her 
You talk too much’ you laugh too loud 
You see her face in every crowd 

That’s the price of love’ the price of love 
A debt you pay with tears and pain 
The price of love’ the price of love 
It costs you more when you’re to blame 

Kiss one girl’ kiss another 
Kiss them all but you won’t recover 
You’re dancing slow’ you’re dancing fast 
You’re happy now’ but that won’t last 

That’s the price of love’ the price of love 
A debt you pay with tears and pain 
The price of love’ the price of love 
It costs you more when you’re to blame"
188,The Sinner In Me ,"If I could just hide
The sinner inside 
And keep him denied 
How sweet life would be 
If I could be free 
From sinner in me

I'll never be a saint 
It's not a picture that your memory paints 
Not renowned for my patience 
I'm not renowned for my restraint 
But you're always around 
You can always be found 
To pick me up when I'm on the ground 

If I could just hide
The sinner inside 
And keep him denied 
How sweet life would be 
If I could be free 
From sinner in me 

I'm still recovering 
Still getting over all the suffering 
More known for my anger than for any other thing 
But you've always tried 
To be by my side 
And catch my fall when I start to slide 

If I could just hide
The sinner inside 
And keep him denied 
How sweet life would be 
If I could be free 
From sinner in me"
189,The Sun And The Moon And The Stars ,"One subtle look,
God help me
Is all it took
To sell me
One single word
Unspoken
Your name unheard
And I’m broken

The sun and the moon and the stars in the sky are laughing
They’ve seen it all before
For the wind in the trees and the waves on the seas
It’s the same thing
They can’t take any more

One gentle touch,
And I’m helpless
It’s all too much,
For my senses
One simple breathe,
Denied me
When you’re not there
Beside me

The sun and the moon and the stars in the sky are laughing
They’ve seen it all before
For the wind in the trees and the waves on the seas
It’s the same thing
They can’t take any more"
190,The Sun And The Rainfall ,"Someone will call
Something will fall
And smash on the floor.
Without reading the text,
Know what comes next.
Seen it before
And it's painful.

Things must change.
We must re-arrange them
Or we'll have to estrange them.
All that I'm saying
A game's not worth playing
Over and over again.

You're the one I like best,
You retain my interest,
You're the only one.
If it wasn't for you,
Don't know what I'd do.
Unpredictable like the sun
And the rainfall.

Things must change.
We must re-arrange them
Or we'll have to estrange them.
All that I'm saying
A game's not worth playing
Over and over again."
191,The Sweetest Condition ,"Taken in by the delicate noise 
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder 
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice 
Wandering around in silent wonder 

What chance did I have 
With the silver moon 
Hanging in the sky 
Opening old wounds 

Taking hold of the hem of your dress 
Cleanliness only comes in small doses 
Bodily whole but my head's in a mess 
Fuelling obsession that borders psychosis 

It's a sad disease 
Creeping through my mind 
Causing disabilities 
Of the strangest kind 

Getting lost in the folds of your skirt 
There's a price that I pay for my mission 
A body in heaven and a mind full of dirt 
How I suffer the sweetest condition 

Taken in by the delicate noise 
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder 
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice 
Wandering around in silent wonder"
192,The Things You Said ,"I heard it from my friends 
About the things you said 
I heard it from my friends 
About the things you said 

But they know me better than that 
They know me better than that 

They know my weaknesses 
I never tried to hide them 
They know my weaknesses 
I never denied them 

I heard it from my friends 
About the things you said 
I heard it from my friends 
About the things you said 

How can a view become so twisted 
How can a view become so twisted 

They know my weaknesses 
I never tried to hide them 
They know my weaknesses 
You tried them 

I get so carried away 
You brought me down to earth 
I thought we had something precious 
Now I know what it's worth 

I heard it from my friends 
About the things you said 
I heard it from my friends 
About the things you said 

I've never felt so disappointed 
Never felt so disappointed 

They know my weaknesses 
I never tried to hide them 
They know my weaknesses 
Thought that you liked them 

They know me better than that"
193,The Worst Crime ,"There's a lynching in the square
You will have to join us
Everyone's going to be there
We're setting up the truss
Once there was solutions 
Now we have no excuses
They got lost in confusion
So we're preparing the nooses

And oh we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?

Blame misinformation
Misguided leaders
Apathetic hesitation
Uneducated readers
For whatever reason
We now find ourselves in this
We are all charged with treason
There is no one left to hiss

And oh we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?

We're the judge and the jury
The hangman, the convict
It's too late for fury
Our indictment was handpicked
So step out to the gallows
And accept your sentence
For being so shallow
You must pay a penance

And oh we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?

And oh we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?"
194,To Have And To Hold ,"I need to be cleansed
It's time to make amends
For all of the fun
The damage is done
And I feel diseased
I'm down on my knees
And I need forgiveness
Someone to bear witness
To the goodness within
Beneath the sin
Although I may flirt 
With all kinds of dirt
To the point of disease
Now I want release
From all this decay
Take it away
And somewhere
There's someone who cares
With a heart of gold 
To have and to hold"
195,Told You So ,"And do those feet in modern times 
Walk upon the flowers and 
Walk upon their brothers while their 
Heads are busy lying low 
Trying to keep to cover, oh 

Something went wrong along the way 
Everybody's waiting for judgment day 
So they can go ""Told you so"" 
They can go ""Told you so"" 

Bring me my gun of itching desire 
Bring me my bullets and I will fire 
Sights set higher than the tall church spire 

Something went wrong along the way 
Everybody's waiting for judgment day 
So they can go ""Told you so"" 
They can go ""Told you so"" 

Standing in line, the blind lead the blind 
Waiting and waiting for an overdue sign 
Brothers and sisters playing Chinese Whispers 
If things aren't suited then they'll get diluted 

Here's one more dead with a hole in his head 
He shouldn't have said all the things he said 
Many tears were shed for the blood he bled 

Something went wrong along the way 
Everybody's waiting for judgment day 
So they can go ""Told you so"" 
They can go ""Told you so"""
196,Tomorrow's dance ,"Saturday night, you look so chic 
Been waiting for this moment, been waiting all week 
The pub is crowded, much too hot 
The boys, they're dancing, they just can't stop 

Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance 
You dance your dance, you dance your chance 
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance 
You dance with pride and you dance with pride 

Ice cold drinks, get sold tonight 
We're gonna get happy, the occasion is right 
You start to move, you take the floor 
The music is better than ever before 

Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance 
You dance your dance, you dance your chance 
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance 
You dance with pride and you dance with pride 

3 AM, I just can't last 
The music is loud and much too fast 
You cannot get out, you wanna stay 
You gotta hang out, another dancing day 

Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance 
You dance your dance, you dance your chance 
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance 
You dance with pride and you dance with pride 
"
197,Tora! Tora! Tora! ,"They were raining from the sky
Exploding in my heart
Is this a love in disguise
Or just a form of modern art

From the skies you could almost hear them cry
Tora Tora Tora
In the town they were 
Going down
Tora Tora Tora

I had a nightmare only yesterday
You played a skeleton
You took my love then died that day
I played an American

From the skies you can almost hear them cry
Tora Tora Tora
In the town they were 
Going down
Tora Tora Tora

I played an American
I played an American
I played an American
I played an American
I played an American
I played an American
I played an American"
198,Two Minute Warning ,"We're lying by the orange sky
Two million miles across the land
Scattered to the highest high
Expect they'll either laugh or cry

No sex, no consequence, no sympathy
You're good enough to heat

Two minute warning two minutes later
When time has come my days are numbered
Two minute warning two minutes later
When time has come my days are numbered

The dawning of another year
Marks time for those who understand
One in four still here
While you and I go hand in hand

No radio, no sound, no sin, no sanctuary
So welcome to your last

Two minute warning two minutes later
When time has come my days are numbered
Two minute warning

The sun, the solitude, the cemetery
So welcome to your last

Two minute warning two minutes later
When time has come my days are numbered
Two minute warning two minutes later
When time has come my days are numbered
Two minute warning two minutes later
When time has come my days are numbered"
199,Until You've Sown The Seed ,"Remember Rome wasn't built in a day
Where there's a will, there must be a way
Or maybe it's like trying to find a needle in the hay

Remember two wrongs won't make a right
So don't give up without a fight
Cause we're just like ships that go bump in the night

And you won't reap the harvest
Until you've sown the seed

So don't start to run until you can walk
Try to look me in the eye when you talk
Cause we're about as similar as cheese and chalk

What comes from within can come from above
Like an iron hand in a velvet glove
Cause love is all, and all you need is love

And you won't reap the harvest
Until you've sown the seed
And you won't reap the harvest
Until you've sown the seed

And you won't reap the harvest
Until you've sown the seed
And you won't reap the harvest
Until you've sown the seed"
200,Useless ,"Well it's about time 
It's beginning to hurt 
Time you made up your mind 
Just what is it all worth 

All my useless advice 
All my hanging around 
All your cutting down to size 
All my bringing you down 

Watch the clock on the wall 
Feel the slowing of time 
Hear a voice in the hall 
Echoing in my mind 

All your stupid ideals 
Got your head in the clouds 
You should see how it feels 
With your feet on the ground 

Here I stand the accused 
With your fist in my face 
Feeling tired and bruised 
With the bitterest taste 

All my useless advice 
All my hanging around 
All your cutting down to size 
All my bringing you down 

All your stupid ideals 
Got your head in the clouds 
You should see how it feels 
With your feet on the ground"

So you let that go too
Let's all go on the rampage
And pulverize some mindless jerk

Violence

202,Wagging Tongue  ,"You won't do well to silence me
With your words or wagging tongue
With your long tall tales of sorrow
Your song yet to be sung

I won't be offended
If I'm left across the great divide
Believe me, they will follow
Just to watch another angel die
Watch another angel die

You won't do well to darken me
With your secrets and your lies
With your piercing code of silence
Relax enjoy the ride

I'll meet you by the river
Or maybe on the other side
You find it hard to swallow
When you watch another angel die
Watch another angel die

Another sun is rising
Another day has come
You can find me, I'll be waiting
Until the day is done
I won't be persuaded
Kiss your doubts goodbye
Everything seems hollow
When you watch another angel die

Watch another angel die"
203,Waiting For The Night ,"I'm waiting for the night to fall 
I know that it will save us all 
When everything's dark 
Keeps us from the stark reality 

I'm waiting for the night to fall 
When everything is bearable 
And there in the still 
All that you feel is tranquillity 

There is a star in the sky 
Guiding my way with its light 
And in the glow of the moon 
Know my deliverance will come soon 

I'm waiting for the night to fall 
I know that it will save us all 
When everything's dark 
Keeps us from the stark reality 

I'm waiting for the night to fall 
When everything is bearable 
And there in the still 
All that you feel is tranquillity 

There is a sound in the calm 
Someone is coming to harm 
I press my hands to my ears 
It's easier here just to forget fear 

And when I squinted 
The world seemed rose-tinted 
And angels appeared to descend 
To my surprise 
With half-closed eyes 
Things looked even better 
Than when they were open 

Been waiting for the night to fall 
I knew that it would save us all 
Now everything's dark 
Keeps us from the stark reality 

Been waiting for the night to fall 
Now everything is bearable 
And here in the still 
All that you feel is tranquility"
204,Walking in my shoes ,"I would tell you about the things 
They put me through 
The pain I've been subjected to 
But the Lord himself would blush 
The countless feasts laid at my feet 
Forbidden fruits for me to eat 
But I think your pulse would start to rush 

Now I'm not looking for absolution 
Forgiveness for the things I do 
But before you come to any conclusions 
Try walking in my shoes 
Try walking in my shoes 

You'll stumble in my footsteps 
Keep the same appointments I kept 
If you try walking in my shoes 
If you try walking in my shoes 

Morality would frown upon 
Decency look down upon 
The scapegoat fate's made of me 
But I promise now, my judge and jurors 
My intentions couldn't have been purer 
My case is easy to see 

I'm not looking for a clearer conscience 
Peace of mind after what I've been through 
And before we talk of any repentance 
Try walking in my shoes 
Try walking in my shoes 

You'll stumble in my footsteps 
Keep the same appointments I kept 
If you try walking in my shoes 
If you try walking in my shoes 
Try walking in my shoes 

Now I'm not looking for absolution 
Forgiveness for the things I do 
But before you come to any conclusions 
Try walking in my shoes 
Try walking in my shoes 

You'll stumble in my footsteps 
Keep the same appointments I kept 
If you try walking in my shoes 

You'll stumble in my footsteps 
Keep the same appointments I kept 
If you try walking in my shoes 
Try walking in my shoes 
If you try walking in my shoes 
Try walking in my shoes"
205,Welcome To My World ,"Welcome to my world,
 Step right through the door,
 Leave your tranquilisers at home
 You don't need them anymore
All the dramaqueens have gone
And the devil got dismayed,
He packed up and fled this town
His master plan delayed

 And if you stay a while
 I'll penetrate your soul
 I'll bleed into your dreams
 You'll want to lose control
 I'll weep into your eyes
 I'll make your visions sing
 I'll open endless skies
 And ride your broken wings
 Welcome to my world
 Welcome to my world
 Welcome to my world

 We'll watch the sunrise set
 And the moon begin to blush
 Our naked innocence
 Translucently too much
And I'll hold you in my arms
And keep you by my side
And we'll sleep the devil's sleep,
Just to keep him satisfied."

207,When The Body Speaks ,"To the soul's desires 
The body listens 
What the flesh requires 
Keeps the heart imprisoned 

What the spirit seeks 
The mind will follow 
When the body speaks 
All else is hollow 

I'm just an angel 
Driving blindly 
Through this world 

I'm just a slave here 
At the mercy 
Of a girl 

Oh I need your tenderness 
Oh I need your touch 
Oh I dream of one caress 
Oh I pray too much 

To the soul's desires 
The body listens 
What the flesh requires 
Keeps the heart imprisoned 

What the spirit seeks 
The mind will follow 
When the body speaks 
All else is hollow 

You keep me waiting 
For the promise 
That is mine 

Please stop debating 
Please stop wasting 
Your time 

Oh I need your tenderness 
Oh I need your touch 
Oh I dream of one caress 
Oh I pray too much"
208,Where's the Revolution ,"You've been kept down
You've been pushed 'round
You've been lied to

You or your religion
Your government, your countries
You patriotic junkies

Where's the revolution?
Come on, people
You're letting me down
Where's the revolution?
Come on, people

With terror as a weapon
Scare you till you're stupefied
Wear you down until you're on their side

You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard 
If you want anything at all 

Nothing comes easy 
It never will 
Nothing comes easy 
But a broken will 

You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard 
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard 
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard 
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard 

You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard 
If you want anything at all 
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard 
If you want anything at all 

You've got to work hard 
You've got to work hard 
You've got to work hard 
So work hard!

210,World Full Of Nothing ,"Close 
Naked 
Skin on skin 
Tears are falling 
Tears of joy 
Her first boy 
His first girl 
Makes a change 
In a world full of nothing 
Though it's not love 
It means something 

She's lonely 
And he says 
It's for her only 
That he lusts 
She doesn't trust him 
Nothing is true 
But he will do 

In a world full of nothing 
Though it's not love 
It means something 

It's easy to slip away 
And believe it all 

Though it's not love 
It means something"
211,World in my eyes ,"Let me take you on a trip 
Around the world and back 
And you won't have to move 
You just sit still 

Now let your mind do the walking 
And let my body do the talking 
Let me show you the world in my eyes 

I'll take you to the highest mountain 
To the depths of the deepest sea 
And We won't need a map, believe me 

Now let my body do the moving 
And let my hands do the soothing 
Let me show you the world in my eyes 

That's all there is 
Nothing more than you can feel now 
That's all there is 

Let me put you on a ship 
On a long, long trip 
Your lips close to my lips 
All the islands in the ocean 
All the heaven's in the motion 
Let me show you the world in my eyes 

That's all there is 
Nothing more than you can touch now 
That's all there is 

(8x)Let me show you the world in my eyes"
212,Wrong ,"Wrong
Wrong

Wrong

I was born with the wrong sign
In the wrong house
With the wrong ascendancy
I took the wrong road
That led to
The wrong tendencies
I was in the wrong place
At the wrong time
For the wrong reason
And the wrong rhyme
On the wrong day
Of the wrong week
Used the wrong method
With the wrong technique
Wrong
Wrong

There's something wrong with me chemically
Something wrong with me inherently
The wrong mix
In the wrong genes
I reached the wrong ends
By the wrong means
It was the wrong plan
In the wrong hands
The wrong theory
For the wrong man
The wrong eyes
On the wrong prize
The wrong questions
With the wrong replies
Wrong
Wrong

I was marching to the wrong drum
With the wrong scum
Pissing out the wrong energy
Using all the wrong lines
And the wrong signs
With the wrong intensity
I was on the wrong page
Of the wrong book
With the wrong rendition
Of the wrong look
With the wrong moon
Every wrong night
With the wrong tune playing
Till it sounded right, yeah

Wrong

Too long

I was born with the wrong sign
In the wrong house
With the wrong ascendancy 
(Too long)
I took the wrong road
That led to
The wrong tendencies
(Too long)
I was in the wrong place
At the wrong time
For the wrong reason

And the wrong rhyme
On the wrong day
Of the wrong week
Used the wrong method

213,You Move ,"We had something but that was yesterday
Temptation's knocking at my door
You talk to me about the life we could've had
But we don't have that life no more

But I like the way you move
Yeah, I like the way you move for me tonight
I like the way you move
I like the way you move for me tonight
Alright now

If you give me something that you and I can play
Let me ring your bell
I don't need you, I don't need your ball and chain
There's no water in that well

But I like the way you move
I like the way you move for me tonight
I like the way you move
I like the way you move for me tonight
Alright yeah
All night
Alright now
All night

Imagination is all it takes
You came knocking at my door
You talk to me about the life that we should have
You know you could have given more

But I like the way you move
I like the way you move for me tonight
I like the way you move
I like the way you move for me tonight
Alright now

All night"
