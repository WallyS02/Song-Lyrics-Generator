0,End Of The Beginning,"



Is this the end of the beginning?
Or the beginning of the end?
Losing control or are you winning?
Is your life real or just pretend?

Reanimation of the sequence
Rewind the future to the past.
To find the source of the solution;
The system has to be recast.

Release your mind.
Fast forward to the secrets of your code.
Your life's on overload.
Delete or save

The units that make you an entity
That's your identity
If you don't know
Which way to go

You may be lost and confused
A second chance your turn to lose

Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul.
Transforming time and space beyond control;
Rise up  resist and be the master of your fate.
Don't look back live for today - tomorrow is too late.

You don't want to be a robot ghost
Occupied inside a human host
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly
Synthesized until they set you free.

Alright-okay alright till they set you free...
Alright-okay till they set you free, free, free, free
I don't want to see you yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't want to see you yeah, yeah, yeah

1,God Is Dead?,"



Lost in the darkness, I fade from the light
Faith of my father, my brother, my Maker and Savior
Help me make it through the night
Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb
Into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine

The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine, you keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?

Rivers of evil, run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal, and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?

When will this nightmare be over?
Tell me
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?

To safeguard my philosophy
Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a living death
I empathize with enemies
Until the timing's right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light

I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine
I don't need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I don't believe that God is dead
God is dead

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word what the Good Book said?
Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead?
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead, right?

But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that God is dead
The blood pours down, the rain turns red
I don't believe that God is dead
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead

2,Loner,"



He's just a loner
He never says hello
A friend to no one
He's got no place to go

He don't look happy
He look through furtive eyes
He ain't got nothing
No one to sympathize

Alright now

He hides himself away
His secrets not revealed
As life just passes by he keeps himself concealed

A solitary man
An enigmatic child
A riddle never solved
A prisoner exiled

Alright now

I wonder if the loner can assimilate
A life less lived alone plays devil's advocate

Come on yeah

Has he ever tried to be happy?
Reached out from inside
Someone on who he can depend
It's getting too late to recover
He won't stand a chance and into his own hell he'll descend

Don't descend [x4]

No understanding of things we already know
He has to live his life and just learn how to let go

Communication's an impossibility
His own best friend but he's his own worst enemy
The secrets of his past locked deep inside his head
I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead

Come on yeah

3,Zeitgeist,"



Astral engines in reverse
I'm falling through the universe again
Down among the deadmen's vision
Faded dreams and nuclear fission spent

The strings of theory are holding up the race
The puppets falling to the ground
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space
Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found
On this sinking ship I travel

Faster than the speed of light
Not so supernova burns
The black holes turn and fade from sight
The strings of theory hide in the human race
The answers buried underground
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space
Lost in time, I wonder will my ship be found

And very soon
The Bomber's moon
Will show us light
And as we crash
We'll pray and kiss
And say goodnight
Goodnight

4,Age Of Reason,"



Do you hear the thunder
Raging in the sky?
Premonition of
A shattered world that's gonna die.

In the Age of Reason,
how do we survive?
The protocols of evil
Ravaging so many lives?

Mystifying silence
Talking Peace on Earth.
We should judge each other
For ourselves not what we're worth.

Sustainable extinction,
A fractured human race.
A jaded revolution
Disappears without a trace.

Always felt that there'd be trouble.
Mass distraction hides the truth.
Prozac days and sleepless hours.
Seeds of change that don't bear fruit.

These time are heavy
And you're all alone.
The battle's over
But the war goes on.

Politics, religion,
Love of money too.
It's what the world was built for
But not for me and you.

5,Live Forever,"



Just before you die
They say you'll see your life go flashing by
Cold dark endless nights
To burn in hell or bathe in heaven's light

Well I don't wanna live forever
But I don't want to die...
I may be dreaming but whatever
I live inside a lie!

Days pass by too soon
Waiting for the rising of the moon
No escape from here
Facing death but is your conscience clear?

I may be dreaming or whatever
Watching my life go by
And I don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die!

Well, I don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die
I may be dreaming but whatever
I live inside a lie

Don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die
Don't wanna live forever

6,Damaged Soul,"



Born in a graveyard adopted by sin,
I cultivate evil that's living within.
A preacher tried saving my black damaged soul,
Possessed by a demon that had full control.

The time it is coming when all life will end,
With doomsday approaching to hell we'll descend.
Religion won't save me, the damage is done.
The future has ended before it's begun.

Death's hand and the crazy, I can't stand the light of day.
Watching all the victims on their knees as they pray.
God of the almighty never answers their call.
Satan is just waiting for the righteous to fall to him.

I don't mind dying 'cause I'm already dead.
Pray not for the living I'll live in your head.
Dying is easy it's living that's hard.
I'm losing the battle between Satan and God.

7,Dear Father,"



A childhood innocence was drowned in your tears.
The demons that you fought are feeding your fears.
The poisoned secrets of your life stand revealed.
The truth destroys you, its no longer concealed.

Dear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing.
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin.
Yeah, in ruin, yeah.

You preyed upon my flesh then prayed for my soul.
Belief betrayed by lust, the faith that you stole.
Indoctrination by a twisted desire,
The catechism of an evil messiah.

Dear father forgive me, I know just what I'm doing.
In silence this violence will leave your life in ruin.
Yeah, in ruin, yeah.

Preacher of theocracy hiding your hypocrisy.
Under false sanctity, holy phoney empathy.
You have taken my life,
Now it's your turn to die.

Can you sleep at night? When you close your eyes
Do you think of all the pain from your lies?
Or do you deny you're responsible
For the victims of the sins you devised?

What you gonna tell them when they ask you? Well then
Is your conscience pure in your heart?
There is no exemption when you seek redemption
For all the lives that you've torn apart.

Your molestations of the cross you defiled,
A man once holy now despised and reviled.
You took possession while confessing my sins
And now you have to face whatever death brings, yeah.

Dear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing.
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin, yeah.

Figure in black which points at me
Turn around quick, and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one

Big black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh no, no, please God help me

Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware

Misty morning, clouds in the sky
Without warning, the wizard walks by
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
Funny clothes, tinkling bell

Never talking
Just keeps walking

Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by

Never talking
Just keeps walking

Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine

Never talking

Visions cupped within a flower
Deadly petals with strange power
Faces shine a deadly smile
Look upon you at your trial

Chill that numbs from head to toe
Icy sun with frosty glow
Words that grow read to your sorrow
Words that grow read no tomorrow

Feel your spirit rise with the breeze
Feel your body falling to it's knees
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse

Sleeping wall of remorse

Wall of Sleep is cool and bright
Wall of Sleep is lying broken

The world today is such a wicked place
Fighting going on between the human race
People got to work just to earn their bread
While people just across the sea are counting their dead

A politician's job, they say, is very high
For he has to choose who's got to go and die
They can put a man on the moon quite easy
While people here on earth are dying of old diseases

A woman goes to work every day after day
She just goes to work just to earn her pay
Child sitting crying by a life that's harder
He doesn't even know who is his father

Now the first day that I met ya
I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
And the thunderclouds rolled by
The sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
To leave you well alone
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong

You never said you love me
And I don't believe you can
'Cause I saw you in a dream 
And you were with another man
You looked so cool and casual
And I tried to look the same
But now I've got to know ya
Tell me who have I to blame?
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong

Now the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never known
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong

16,Trashed,"



It really was a meeting
The bottle took a beating
The ladies of the manor
Watched me climb into my car and
I was going down the track about a hundred and five
They had the stop-watch rolling
I had the headlights blazing I was really alive
And yet my mind was blowing
I drank a bottle of tequila and I feel real good
I had the tape deck roaring
But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn
I went of exploring
I knew I wouldn't make it the car just wouldn't make it
I was turning tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye

I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way
I had the wheels in motion
There was Peter and the Green fly laughing like drains
Inebriation
The crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch
In my imagination
But at the canal turn I hit an oily patch
Inebriation

Ooh Mr. Miracle you saved me from some pain
I thank you Mr. Miracle I won't get trashed again
Ooh can you hear my lies
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes

So we went back to the bar and hit the bottle again
But there was no tequila
Then we started on the whisky just to steady our brains
'Cos there was no tequila
And as we drank a little faster at the top of our hill
We began to roll
And as we get trashed we were laughing still
Well bless my soul

17,Disturbing The Priest,"



Let's try getting to the sky
Hang on or you're going to die
Sour life can turn sweet
It's laying at your feet
Sweet child with an innocent smile
Watched closely all the while
Don't be fooled when he cries
Keep looking at the eyes

Good life is contradiction
Because of the crucifixion
If you're ready and have the need
I will take your soul and plant my seed

You just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day
You just gotta listen to the night as safety slips away
Moving out of sight are the things you need to see to feel
And as they slip away becoming so unreal unreal
You just gotta listen to the night as you're going up stairs
You just gotta listen to the night and don't forget to say your prayers
And as you lose control to the eyes in dark disguise
And icy fingers fan electric lies

We're disturbing the priest
Won't you please come to our feast
Do we mind disturbing the priest
Not at all not at all not in the least

The force of the devil is the darkness the priest has to face
The force of the night will destroy him but will not disgrace
To get into his mind and to his soul you gotta set a light
The flames of doubt so deep inside inside
The devil and the priest can't exist if one goes away
It's just like the battle of the sun and the moon and the night and day
The force of the devil that we're all told to fear
Watched out for religion when he gets too near too near

Accept the fact that you're second rate life is easy for you
It's all served up on a gold plated plate
And we don't even have to talk to you
Your face is normal that's the way you're bred
And that's the way you're going to stay
Your head is firmly nailed to your TV channel
But someone else's finger's on the control panel

What you gonna be brother - Zero the hero
Don't you wanna be brother - Zero the hero
When you gonna be brother - Zero the hero
Impossibility impissibolity mother really a hero

You sit there watch it all burn down
It's easy and breezy for you
You play your life to a different sound
No edge no edge you got no knife have you
Your life is a six lane highway to nowhere
You're going so fast you're never ever gonna get down there
Where the heroes sit by the river
With a magic in their music as they eat raw liver

You stand there captain we all look
You really are mediocre
You are the champion in the Acme form book
But I think you're just a joker
Your freedom life ain't so much of a pity
But the luv-a-duckin' way you're walkin' around
The city with your balls and your head full of nothing
It's easy for you sucker but you really need stuffing

She wears her leather just to satisfy
She really throws it around
There ain't one thing she can't afford to buy
She's the richest bitch in town

Her big fat daddy was a money machine
He made a fortune from computers
She's got more money than I've ever seen
But she's a greedy emotional looter

Keep away from the digital bitch
She's so rich the digital bitch

She's got five rollers and a fine estate
A big house upon hill
She throws parties just to celebrate
Her life is just one ginormous thrill

She buys poor people just to have around
She has a trophy for each lover
The bitch is rich but baby pound for pound
She's got a lot more to discover

Maybe she could please me if I saw beneath her veil
But she's just imitation woman up for sale

She got so famous that she's on TV
She's got a professional smile
But I switch over 'cos she ain't for me
She disturbs me all the while

She looks so happy but she's got it wrong
She's always going faster
She sings her life to such a different song
She needs a loving and dominant master

As you look through my window
Deep into my room
At the tapestries all faded
Their vague and distant glories
Concealed in the gloom
The icy fingers of forgotten passions
Softly brushing my lips
At the tips of my primitive soul

As you look through my door
Deep into my room
Can you feel the mighty wall of power
It's waiting waiting in the glow
The distant shadows of forgotten champions
Those who live in me still
And will rise when we challenge and kill

Born again
You'll be born again

Look at this prince of evil
Fighting for your mind
Fighting all priests of shame
For the thrust of my challenge is aimed
At the hearts of mutant gods
Who think we're all the same
They're controlling our minds
And they use us for fortune and fame

As you look through my window
Deep into my room
At your future and freedom
The grey and plastic retards all floating in circles
And as you taste the fruits of new sensations
Softly brushing your lips
As we rise when we challenge and kill

Born again
You'll be born again

If you want to be a king for a day
Just do what I say

Everybody's got to think like a hunter
Just search for your pray

Be alive through the night and the day
Just do it my way

You better run from the holy man, the eyes that
Will are set up on you,

And voices tempt you
The inner flame has fear of death, never, has
Light ever seemed so dark.

Once there was love now there's a void.

That holds the knife,

Feeds the life.

Through human eyes.

To the hill of the headless cross
Where all witches meet, on a night such as this,
And the power of darkness is host
They come face to face, eye to eye, soul to soul,
With an Angel that fell from the sky
Borne on the air, are the screams and the wails
Of the masses appointed to die

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture,
At the headless cross, at the headless cross

From the first evil night, when a black flash of light
Cut the crucifix half to the ground
There's been no escape from the power of Satan,
On a nation so brave and so proud

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture,
At the headless cross, at the headless cross

How do you feel, when the locks refuse the key
And the master is calling your name,
Does the luck of the charm, really keep you from harm
Does the talisman protect you from pain

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture,
At the headless cross, at the headless cross

When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?

Well I have seen the truth, yes I've seen the light and I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared at the end of our days

Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believe in God above?
They should realize before they criticize
that God is the only way to love

Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say they may as well worship the sun?

I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?
You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve

Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone

Open your eyes
And see the lies, oh yeah

All tomorrow's become yesterday
In demand but second hand
It's been heard before you even play

Up to date but came too late
Better get yourself another name
You're so right but overnight
You're the one who has to take the blame

Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can't believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried

Don't delay you're in today
But tomorrow is another dream
Sunday's star is Monday's scar
Out of date before you're even seen

At the top so quick to flop
You're so new but rotting in decay
Like butterfly so quick to die
But you're only looking for today

Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can't believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried
Looking for today

Glamour trip so soon to slip
Easy come but oh how quick it goes
Ten foot tall but what to fall
Hard to open yet so easy to close
Front page news but so abused
You just want to hide yourself away
Over-paid, but soon you fade
Because you're only looking for today

There's no end - there's no beginning -
To the old man's story
Does he still remember me -
From lives gone by
Oh I see his spirit rising
Upon the back of time
I've got nowhere to hide
Will he keep a place for me

He is the king of all kings
The keeper of light
He holds eternity's wings

In his eyes an ocean's burning
Swollen seat of tears

Troubled mind the beating
War drums in his ears
No one ever hears his warning
Am I the one he calls
When they tell me they're afraid
Some say I'll be put away

He is the king of all kings
The keeper of light
He holds eternity's wings
My blood will spill my blood

My blood will spill my blood

In the wisdom of the prophet's
Never ending tale
Open up the eyes
Within your mind, he says
Crowned in his ancient glory
There's a king within us all
Some will say it's all in vain
That he doesn't have a name

He is the king of all kings
The keeper of light
He holds eternity's wings

132,Hard Life To Love,"



Livin' in the fast is easy
Till you run out of road
Friends will turn to strangers
When you're out of control
A slip of the tongue when
It's done, is often hard to
See it thru
So never let your words be lies
Or they'll come looking for you

It's a hard life to love

For the price of glory you left
And threw your fortunes away
Never really cared too much for
The job or the pay

You're standing in the rain with
No cover but you never complain
You're an angry young man face to
Face but your mirrors insane
It's a hard life to love

I'm simply refusing a part in your world
And I see how it burns
See how it burns
And you're simply denying the fact
That you're blind and I see no more
I see red - I only see red

Think of all the times I was
Hurting but you felt no pain
Think of all the lies you told me
Again and again
And still you see the truth
From those who continue to lie
And now you're seeking life
From those who are living to die
It's a hard life to love

I'm simply refusing a part in your world
And I see how it burns
See how it burns
And you're simply denying the fact
That you're blind and I see no more
I see red - I only see red

Livin' in the fast lane ain't easy
When you run out of road
Friends will turn to strangers
When you've nowhere to go
Don't give a damn when you're lost
Cause you'll die from it all
Laws were made to be broken
And you do it for the thrill of it all
It's a hard life to love
It's a hard life to love

Winged with steel they fill the air
The soldiers of fortune will ride
In the sights of the enemy's gun
Those who have taken their oaths
Tonight
Are well prepared they know they'll
Door die even if it's suicide

Let's take a chance
As the skies will Burn tonite
Wasted lives and spirits run free
On the wings of no return

Dressed to kill where eagles dare
The fate of a nation's at hand
Is this the answer to the prayers
Come the dawn, thru the blood
Red skies return with tears
In their eyes, and they
Recall thou shalt not kill

And in the morning
They'll take a hero's bow
And make the ever lasting flight

Hear them calling up above all
Across the skies
Hear them calling up above from
The other side

Here them call!

Let's take a chance
As the skies will burn tonite
Wasted lives and spirits run free
On the wings of no return

Broken chains, like a prisoner free at last

See a vision filled with wings
Head my way
Feel the presence of unknown power
Telling me to come
This is the only way

It's dream within dream

Don't get pulled by the devil's hand

Silent screamer filled with fear
As the night time shapes a face
Then disappears
Scared forever into believing
That your mind has met the
Prince of whom you see

It's dream within dream

Don't get fooled by the
Devil's hand

Fool forever, don't get fooled

Don't get fooled, be the devil

The evil spirit rises
Blinded by the dark
You fall into shame
As the reaper takes you
Down the spiral stairway
You share the evil pit
With satan's name

All your life you're bin slipping and sliding
Trying to find a way
Sun won't shine but now it's your time to pay
There's no turning back as you look
The hangman in the eye
Now hell's just your death away
It's too late to say you care
When there's evil in your stare
You say you're not to blame

In your head voices mocking
Every prayer

Remember the face you saw
That once was you
Spirit high there's no way that
You could lose
Give him rope they said
As you look the hangman in
The eye
Now around your neck you feel
The noose

In your head voices mocking
Every prayer
Now you're lost forever

I'm burning with fire it's time to
Leave or get out
I'm burning in fire I can't take
No more so get out
I'm burning with fire the wheels of
Steel will grind you
Burning in fire this time
You're lost forever
Lost forever!

There's an evil in your stare
Lost forever!
And hell's just a breath away
You're lost forever
And there's no way out you burn
With fire it's time to get out
Get out, get out

Can you hear me crying out for life?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over you'll find the answer
Running in the whispering rain

Truth of thunder, life or blame

Do you see a vision of a perfect place?
Does it make you laugh, put a smile on your face?
Do you need a mirror, do you see it well?
Does the hand of God still toll the bell?
There are people laughing
They're all laughing on you
If only they could see what you're saying is true
Still generals fighting, making war on the world
Don't they know, don't they know?

Depend on another to fight it alone

Where darkness once would hide
With spirits high, our fears were born

Silence still the air and kills the chime

Can faith destroy desire? Each breath a prayer
Each step brings fear
The eyes of they that see have evil stare
Watch over me

In the land of fairy tales and stories
Lost in happiness I knew no fears

Lost in the wheels of confusion
Running through valleys of tears
Eyes full of angry delusion
Hiding in everyday fears
