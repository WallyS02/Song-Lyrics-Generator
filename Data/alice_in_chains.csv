0,A Little Bitter ,"How the mind does shout for rest 
When the bodies shaken, yeah 
Oh the tightness in my chest 
Still your leaves I'm raking 

Lord is this a test 
Was it fun creating, yeah? 
My god's a little sick 
And he wants me crazy 

Who 
Are you 
Who can say 
It's ok to live through me? 

Live to be 
Part of me 
You're a wrinkled magazine 
Yeah 

Was it something that I said? 
Was it how they're breaking, yeah 
I'm so selfish, paying your rent 
While your blood I'm taking 

You 
Spend me 
Like a tree 
Dirty dollar bills for leaves 
Dark in a sea 
Of my seeds 
And the tears on which you feed 

You feed 

The body is a temple 
A dormant alter 
To where infantile men lie around 
Itching and nibbling 
For a small piece of sanity 
Of which you can not give 

Shit! 

Individuality 
Buying pennies with my soul 
And a little Heaven spent 
While the Hell I'm taking 

Thieves 
Parasites 
Hide from life 
You know they'll remember me 

They are abhored 
In self-worth 
All that matters much to me"
1,A Looking In View ,"Hear footsteps creak the floor
The shadows give away
Someone outside the door
Won't let 'em in

Life damaged gears to grind
A run down, broke machine
That steals your peace of mind
Before you know it's gone...

Lay down
Wait

Silence burning, hold your tongue
Keep us separate, sullen, dumb

Hiding in a darkness under
Boiling to the surface, stumble fall

A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life

These things I hate in you
Are so reflect it seems
Distortion laced with spite
Takes you out of me...

Lay down
Layin

Hiding in a darkness under
Boiling to the surface something
Crawling on your skin, discomfort
Makes you break and run, stumble fall

A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life

It's why you never tell me whatever's on your mind

Looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life

It's why you never tell me whatever's on your mind"
2,Acid Bubble ,"You tried to kill me off
Surprised I remain
A scale tips, impossible
Afraid of my own name

And I always paid attention to all the lines you crossed
Forgive this imperfection it shows, and know
I am the child that lives and cries in a corner
Dies in a corner

Alone inside your mind

Intent obsolescence
Built into the system

I tried to shake it off
You can't remove this stain
A scale breaks, impossible
Afraid we are the same

And you never paid attention to all the lines I crossed
Forgive this imperfection it shows, and know
I am the child that lives and cries in a corner
Dies in a corner

Alone inside your mind

Hides in a corner
Dies in a corner
Alone inside your mind


Intent obsolescence
Built into the system"
3,Again ,"Hey, let 'em do it again, yeah
Hey, you said you were my friend
Hey, turn me upside down, oh
Hey, feelin' so down
Hey, hey

You made a fool of me again, and again...

Hey, I know I made the same mistake, yeah
I, I won't do it again, no
Why, why you slap me in the face, ow
I, I didn't say it was ok, no
No, oo...

You violate a part of me again, again and again...

Ah, ooo
Whoo whoo, yeah...

Hey, you had time to think it out, yeah
Hey, your weak will won't help her heal her heart
Hey, I bet it really eats you up, oh

Extending part of me again, and again and again... 
And again!

Yeah... yeah... yeah...
Whoo whoo, yeah, oh"
4,All I Am ,"Cannot recognize the face before me
It's unfamiliar
Time has left me broken down and homely
Can you still see me undisguised?

Outside the window of your eyes
Clinging to the memory of your prime
After many years the road you wandered
Left you here alone, deprived of others

On your toes or on your heels
There's a line drawn on the floor
Where the blood has dried there is no shine
Have another go my friend
You see I can't feel any more
While you question just who the hell am I

Is this all I am?
Given all I can?
Is this all I am?

Till the end of time
Never knowing why

Ghosts and damage no advantage for me
I'm past believing
Understand the price you pay disarming
When you can leave it all behind

Outside the window of your eyes
Clinging to the memory of your prime
After many years the road you wandered
Left you here alone, deprived of others

On your toes or on your heels
There's a hole worn in the floor
Where the blood has dried there is no shine
Have another go my friend
You see I can't feel any more
While you question just who the hell am I

Is this all I am?
Given all I can?
Is this all I am?

Till the end of time
Never knowing why

Cannot recognize the face before me
It's unfamiliar"
5,All Secrets Known ,"Hope,
A new beginning
Time, 
Time to start living

Like just before we died

There's no going back 
To the place 
We started from

Hurt, 
Falling through fingers
Trust, 
Trust in the feeling

There's something left inside

There's no going back 
To the place 
we started from

All secrets known...

Calm, 
All wounds are healing
Strong, 
Truth is worth saving

I want to feel alive

There's no going back 
To the place 
we started from

All secrets known..."
6,Am I Inside ,"Loneliness it shadows me, quicker than darkness
Crawls to the surface of my skin, visibly surrounded by it

Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free

Surrounded by empty souls, artificial courage used
And because so, once was mine
I walk this maze alone

Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free

The man's beside himself, man's below himself
Man's behind himself, Am I inside myself

Chaos and hate shadow me, pain it fills me up
Only one thing makes me feel, missing better half of me

Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free

The man's beside himself, man's below himself
Man's behind himself, Am I inside myself

Chaos and hate shadow me, hate it fills me up
Only one thing makes me feel, missing better half of me

Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free

The man's beside himself, man's below himself
Man's behind himself, Am I inside myself"
7,Angry Chair ,"Sitting on an angry chair
Angry walls that steal the air
Stomach hurts and I don't care

What do I see across the way, hey
See myself molded in clay, oh
Stares at me, yeah I'm afraid, hey
Changing the shape of his face, oh... yeah

Candles red I have a pair
Shadows dancing everywhere
Burning on the angry chair

Little boy made a mistake, hey
Pink cloud has now turned to gray, oh
All that I want is to play, hey
Get on your knees, time to pray, oh

I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, I-I-I
I don't mind, yeah,
I don't mind, I-I-I
Lost my mind, yeah
But I don't mind, I-I-I
Can't find it anywhere
I don't mind

Corporate prison, we stay, hey
I'm a dull boy, work all day, oh
So I'm strung out anyway, hey

Loneliness is not a phase
Field of pain is where I graze
Serenity is far away

Saw my reflection and cried, hey
So little hope that I died, oh
Feed me your lies, open wide, hey
Weight of my heart, not the size, oh

I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, I-I-I
I don't mind, yeah,
I don't mind, I-I-I
Lost my mind, yeah
But I don't mind, i-i-i
Can't find it anywhere
I don't mind

Pink cloud has now turned to gray
All that I want is to play
Get on your knees time to pray, boy"
8,Black Gives Way To Blue ,"I don't want to feel no more
It's easier to keep falling
Imitations are pale
Emptiness...all tomorrows

Haunted by your ghost...

Lay down, black gives way to blue
Lay down, I'll remember you

Fading out by design
Consciously avoiding changes
Curtain's drawn now it's done
Silencing all tomorrows

Forcing a goodbye...

Lay down, black gives way to blue
Lay down, I'll remember you"
9,Bleed The Freak ,"My cup runneth over
Like blood from a stone

These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I like to see
How you all would bleed for me

When the pig runs slower
Let the arrow fly
When the sin lies bolder
I'll pluck out thine eye

These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I like to see
How you all would bleed for me

If you scorn my lover
Satan got your thigh
If you steal in hunger
I will kick you when you try

These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I like to see
How you all would bleed for me

(In Backround) ""All these things that you've done for me,
Have left me so... FUCKING TIRED
I'm not saying that you haven't done a lot of good,
But if there's one thing you can do,
You can BLEED FOR ME, BLEED FOR ME""
These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I like to see
How you all would bleed for me

These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I like to see
How you all would bleed for me"
10,Blood Tears Little Girl ,"Little girl, where did you go?
Playing in the fields when the sun goes
Before the moon had changed at night
You had fallen out of sight

Little girl, why did you go away?
I was missing you, I knew when I strayed
Didn't mean to lie, didn't mean to cry
I just wanted to say goodbye

Little girl went to the city now
Got lost in this place up high
All the things you learned were almost real
But that denies our strength to heal

Little girl, why did you go away?
I was missing you, I knew when I strayed
Didn't mean to lie, didn't mean to cry
I just wanted to say goodbye

Walking down the street
Walking
My little girl...
Little girl gliding in the sky
came back down to say goodbye
I regret having scared you away
All my fault but nothing to say

Little girl, why did you go away?
I was missing you, I knew when I strayed
Didn't mean to lie, didn't mean to cry
I just wanted to say goodbye

Walking down the street
Walking
My little girl...

I had a girl
Little girl
She loved me more than I used to know
I loved that girl
I thought I would be with her forever"
11,Breath On A Window ,"Mending fence along the road
Barely holding together
Mapless zone the road signs holed
Keep ahead of the weather
Long past time to close dead eyes
Find a break in the highway
Out here I'm invisible
Very few going my way

Breath on a window showing tic tac toe
Rear view reflecting there ain't nobody home

Ghost town trip of misery
I ain't feeling no better
Road kill heart inside of me
Follow it to the letter
Sundown brings a welcome change
Everything that's hiding
More at home in landscapes strange
Are you selling I'm buying

Breath on a window showing tic tac toe
Rear view reflecting there ain't nobody home
Cigarette burn holes outline an old soul
Connect the dot scribbling
And you would never know

Failed to head the signal
Thought you got through just in time
Crashing hard upon your ego
Penetrated from the side


I'd let you go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday

I'd let you go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday"
12,Brother ,"Frozen in the place I hide
Not afraid to paint my sky with
Some who say I've lost my mind
Brother try and hope to find

You were always so far away
I know that pain so don't you run away
Like you used to do

Roses in a vase of white
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves
That fall because my hand is pulling them hard as I can

You were always so far away
I know that pain and I won't run away
Like I used to do

Pictures in a box at home
Yellowing and green with mold
So I can barely see your face
Wonder how that color taste

You were always so far away
I know the way so don't you run away
Like you used to do
Like you used to do"
13,Brush Away ,"I could use some
Time to curl away
My aggression
Is where you stake
Your claim
Why I question
This curve on which you grade
My conception
A joke? Or latest craze?

I try to get away
And yet I stick around
So fall and crawl away
And brush away loose ground

My intention
May I arrive at eight
Lie and dream some
Surprise you guys I'm late
All right, correction, forgetting something
Wait

I try to get away
And yet I stick around
So fall and crawl away
And brush away loose ground
And brush away loose ground
Brush away"
14,Check My Brain ,"And so I found myself in the sun, oh yeah...
A hell of a place to end the run, oh yeah...

California, I’m fine,
Somebody check my brain
California’s alright,
Somebody check my brain

Check my brain

I walked these streets a creep in a fog, oh yeah...
When she sang I answered the call, oh yeah...

California, I’m fine,
Somebody check my brain
California’s alright,
Somebody check my brain

Tears that filled my bong...
Years expended gone..

I hung my guns and put 'em away, oh yeah...
A trick of the trade and by the way, oh yeah...

California, I’m fine,
Somebody check my brain
California’s alright,
Somebody check my brain

Tears that filled my bong,
Years expended gone.
Tears that filled my bong,
Years expended gone.

Check my brain
Check my brain
Check my brain"
15,Chemical Addiction ,"I was only 15, standout on the Ave.
You're chasing a bad dream, a luxury I never had
Living my life in the box, or sleepin in the trash
Taking girls for the things I need, like booze, drugs and ass

Get stoned, daily survival in the war zone
Yeah our teens meant everything, alright
Half rack, smoking out till it's all black
Death trap, watch me going blind, oh

I don't care what you say, I
Or what you do
Chemical addiction is
Getting rid of you
So high, colors turn to sound
Goodbye, let us in and we'll lay you in the ground

Chosen on the floor, take another drag
Bought a bunch of valiums from skinny broadway bag
I don't know much about heroin but I, I wanna try
Just about everything once before I die

Get stoned, daily survival in the war zone
Yeah our teens meant everything, alright
Half rack, smoking out till it's all black
Death trap, watch me going blind, oh

I don't care what you say, I
Or what you do
Chemical addiction is
Getting rid of you
So high, colors turn t"
16,Choke ,"Before you asked for something better
You should know I'm practiced at goodbyes
Are you so deprived
Think you're doing me a favor
I don't need no lesser savior
I'm doing fine

Fragile things so close together
Taped up broken from before
Part of something or all of nothing
A very long hard way to fall

Go then, if you don't feel right
Living in our home
Choking, eat your pride
Eat your pride alone
Go then, if you don't feel right
Living in our home
Choking, eat your pride alone

Needless tension, the walls around you
Built before you came to tear them down
It was you I found
Take some time to think it over
If it's so hard to walk this road we mind
Then it's time to say goodbye

Fragile things so close together
Taped up, broken from before
Part of something or all of nothing
A very long hardway to fall

Go then, if you don't feel right
Living in our home
Choking, eat your pride
Eat your pride alone
Go then, if you don't feel right
Living in our home
Choking, eat your pride alone

(Solo)

So go then, if you don't feel right
Living in our home
Choking, eat your pride
Eat your pride alone
If you don't feel right
Living in our home
Eat your pride alone"
17,Confusion ,"There's no time to give at all 
I cause you grief and blow my hatred 
Further in your mind 
You reach, I run, you fall 
On skinned knees you crawl 


I want to set you free, recognize my disease 
Love, sex, pain, confusion, suffering 
You're there crying, I feel not a thing 
Drilling my way deeper in your head 
Sinking, draining, drowning, bleeding, dead 

So you sit and think of love 
I wait, hate all the more, I fall 
On skinned knees I crawl 

I want to set you free, recognize my disease 
Love, sex, pain, confusion, suffering 
You're there crying, I feel not a thing 
Drilling my way deeper in your head 
Sinking, draining, drowning, bleeding, dead 

Now there's time to give it all 
I put my fears behind again 
On skinned knees we'll crawl 

I want to set you free, recognize my disease 
Love, sex, pain, confusion, suffering 
You're there crying, I feel not a thing 
Drilling my way deeper in your head 
Sinking, draining, drowning, bleeding, dead
Love, sex, pain, confusion, suffering"
18,Dam That River ,"[Verse 1]
I broke you in the canyon
I drowned you in the lake
You a snake that I would trample
Only thing I'd not embrace

[Chorus]
Oh, you couldn't dam that river
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway
So you couldn't dam that river
And it washed me so far away

[Verse 2]
I pushed and then you stumbled
I kicked you in the face
You stare at me so hollow
Got to keep that killing pace

[Chorus]
Oh, you couldn't dam that river
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway
So you couldn't dam that river
And it washed me so far away

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I burned the place around you
I hit you with a rake
You piss upon my candle
So proving you're a fake

[Chorus]
Oh, you couldn't dam that river
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway
So you couldn't dam that river
And it washed me so far away"
19,Deaf Ears Blind Eyes ,"Sinking below view
Time spent a wasting
Alone in a full room
Nobody plays in

I own everything
Whine all set on eleven
I own everything
Cries a soul on fire

Hurt does surround you
Blinded and tied on
Numbness engulfs truth
Let bygones be bygones

I own everything
Whine all set on eleven
I own everything
Cries a soul on fire

And it tears me in a way
Hangin' over
And I feel it's here to stay
Inner coldness so ingrained

Feel like a fake thing
Where did the time go?
Memories worth making
Pass by the window

I own everything
Whine all set on eleven
I own everything
Cries a soul on fire
Soul on fire"
20,Died ,"I could climb until I reach where angels reside
Ask around to find out where the junkies applied
You just up and left me on this rock all alone
It's my fault for knowing not what I should have known

Ohhhh oh oh
My heart is dried up, beating slow
Ohh ohh
Its been deflating since you died
Died
Since you died
You died

I could drop until I touch the sinister side
Visit all attractions flippin back and aside
Still you leave me rotting on this rock all alone
Its my fault for knowing not what I should have known

Ohhhh oh oh
My heart is dried up, beating slow
Ohh ohh
Its been deflating since you died
Died
Since you died
You died

Ohhh oh oh
My heart is dried up, beating slow
Uhh ohh
Its been deflating since you died
Died
Since you died
You died

I could climb until I reach where angels reside
I could drop until I touch the sinister side

Ohhhh oh
My heart is dried up, beating slow
Uhh ohh
Its been deflating since you died
Died
Since you died
You died
Died
You died
Died
You died"
21,Dirt ,"I have never felt such frustration
Or lack of self control
I want you to kill me
And dig me under, I wanna live no more

One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me, 
For me

I want to taste dirty, a stinging pistol
In my mouth, on my tongue
I want you to scrape me from the walls
And go crazy like you've made me

One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me, [x2]
For me

You, you are so special
You have the talent to make me feel like dirt
And you, you use your talent to dig me under
And cover me with dirt

One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me, [x2]"
22,Don't Be Satisfied ,"Oh yeah

Uuuuhuuh

I was raised in a middle class family 
And I (?) in a shiny new car 
Daddy's (?) good cold fear
 That I wouldn't go far

I could be a lawyer and win a case
 Or be a doctor or make a decision
 Taking the hollow, take it today 
I wanna go rags to riches

Take it all the way 
Now that I want
 To make it on my own I see

Don't be satisfied
 Be what you wanna be 
I said Don't be satisfied
 Be what you wanna be
 Don't be satisfied
 Be what you wanna be 
I said
 Don't be satisfied
 Be what you wanna be

It feels better to make it big
 And fall a few times to feel the pain
 When I get back up on my feet again (?) my name

Take it all the way 
Now that I want 
To make it on my own I see

Don't be satisfied 
Be what you wanna be,I said 
Don't be satisfied 
Be what you wanna be
 Don't be satisfied
 Be what you wanna be, I said
 Don't be satisfied
 Be what you wanna be

Don't be satisfied 
Be what you wanna be,I said 
Don't be satisfied 
Be what you wanna be
 Don't be satisfied
 Be what you wanna be, I said
 Don't be satisfied
 Be what you wanna be

Don't be satisfied 
Be what you wanna be,I said 
Don't be satisfied 
Be what you wanna be
 Don't be satisfied
 Be what you wanna be, I said
 Don't be satisfied
 Be what you wanna be"
23,Don't Follow ,"Hey, I ain't never coming home
Hey, I'll just wander my own road
Hey, I can't meet you here tomorrow
Say goodbye don't follow
Misery so hollow

Hey you, you're livin' life full throttle
Hey you, pass me down that bottle, yeah
Hey you, you can't shake me round now
I get so lost and don't know how, yeah
And it hurts to care, I'm going down

Forgot my woman, lost my friends
Things I'd done and where I've been
Sleep in sweat the mirrors cold
See my face it's growin' old
Scared to death no reason why
Do whatever to get me by
Think about the things I said
Read the page it's cold and dead and
Take me home (5x)

Say goodbye Don't follow."
24,Down In A Hole ,"Bury me softly in this womb 
I give this part of me for you 
Sand rains down and here I sit 
Holding rare flowers in a tomb, in bloom

Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved 
See my heart I decorate it like a grave 
You don't understand who they 
Thought I was supposed to be 
Look at me now a man 
Who won't let himself be 

Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, loosing my soul
I'd like to fly, 
But my wings have been so denied 

Down in a hole and they've put all 
The stones in their place 
I've eaten the sun so my tongue 
Has been burned of the taste 
I have been guilty 
Of kicking myself in the teeth 
I will speak no more 
Of my feelings beneath 

Down in a hole, feeling so small 
Down in a hole, loosing my soul 
I'd like to fly 
But my wings have been so denied 

Bury me softly in this womb 
Oh I want to be inside of you 
I give this part of me for you 
Oh I want to be inside of you 
Sand rains down and here I sit 
Holding rare flowers (oh I want to be inside of you) 
In a tomb... in bloom 
Oh I want to be inside... 

Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, loosing my soul
Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, outta control
I'd like to fly 
But my wings have been so denied"
25,Drone ,"In my eyes you are beautiful
Not just right, perfect spiritual
I did what I had to do to get higher

Spent myself on another, entangled like lovers
Not quite dark, not quite light

Steppin' in and out of madness
Such a dedicated drone
And though you find me rather tragic
I'll stay here and feed my pet black hole

In the time I have spent with you
Unconfined, beyond physical
I did not regret my time on the wire

Spent myself on another, entangled like lovers
Not quite dark, not quite light

Steppin' in and out of madness
Such a busy bee, a drone
And though you find me rather tragic

I bear the cost, can't dull my anger
And that's fine
Built up inside, obscuring danger
It's alive

In my eyes you are beautiful
Not just right, perfect spiritual
I did what I had to do to get higher

Spent myself on another, entangled like lovers
Not quite dark, not quite light

Steppin' in and out of madness
Such a dedicated drone
And though you find me rather tragic
I'll stay here and feed my pet black hole

Pet black hole
Pet black hole
Pet black hole

So beautiful"
26,Fairytale Love Story ,"Jill, came tumbling down
At the bottom of the hill
Jack busted his crown
Ah, my fairytale love story
My fairy life
My fairytale love story
To get you off of my..
I got to thinking
Things aren't as good as they can be

Led out on a leash behind you, holding ground
And I don't need no reminding, I've been around
Been around, yeah, I am a sound, yeah

[Verse 2]
Lie down with your peace where you find it
Won't come cheap
Fill up on love when you're hungry, tired then sleep
Have your dreams

[Chorus]
Don't let it wind you, let it bring you down
I hate to tell you how little I have found

[Refrain]
They paved the road with fool's gold

[Bridge]
And you're gonna fall out
You're gonna break down, choke and cry
Waiting out the storm when there ain't no place to hide
And you're gonna fall out
You're gonna break down, choke and cry
Waiting out the storm till the skies are clear to fly

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
And you're gonna fall out
You're gonna break down, choke and cry
Waiting out the storm till the skies are clear to fly

[Verse 3]
Follow where it leads, your heart will know what's true
Don't be blinded by shiny pretty things well past due
It's on you, yeah, it's on you, yeah

[Chorus]
Don't let it wind you, let it bring you down
I hate to tell you how little I have found

[Bridge]
And you're gonna fall out
You're gonna break down, choke and cry
Waiting out the storm when there ain't no place to hide
And you're gonna fall out
You're gonna break down, choke and cry
Waiting out the storm till the skies are clear to fly

[Refrain]
They paved the road with fool's gold
They paved the road with fool's gold"
30,Frogs ,"What does friend mean to you?
 A word so wrongfully abused
 Are you like me, confused
 All included but you
 Alone...

 The sounds of silence often soothe
 Shapes and colors shift with mood
 Pupils widen and change their hue
 Rapid brown avoid clear blue

 Why's it have to be this way
 Be this way

 Flowers watched through wide brown eyes bloom
 A child sings an unclaimed tune
 Innocence spins cold cocoon
 Grow to see the pain too soon

 Why's it have to be this way
 Be this way

 ""At 7 am on a Tuesday, usual August ...
 Next week I'll be 28...
 I'm still young, it'll be me...
 Off the wall I scrape... you...
 I can't wake, I gotta wake...
 To cause this wake, I gotta wake no more...
 It causes wake, to drown this hate....
 To never really stay, never will.....
 You take your plate...
 Put me through hell, live, live...
 Direct your fate...
 You say I can do it so well...
 Your expiration date...
 Fate, date, expiration date...
 (this was the last time)
 Hate...
 And don't fuck with me again...
 My own clean slate...
 Don't fuck with me again...
 Makes your eyes dilate...
 Makes you shake...

Thick fog to hide our smiles...

Feel a tortured brain 
Show your belly like you want me to 

As of now I bet you've got me wrong 
So unsure you run from something strong 

I haven't felt like this in so long 
Wrong, in a sense too far gone from love 
That don't last forever 
Something's gotta turn out right 

You sugar taste 
Sweetness doesn't often touch my face 
Stay if you please 
You may not be here when I leave 

As of now I bet you've got me wrong 
So unsure we reach for something strong 

I haven't felt like this in so long

Wrong, in a sense too far gone from love
That don't last forever
Something's gotta turn out right"

Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside

Sure to play a part
So you love the game
And in truth your lies
Become one and same

I could set you free
Rather hear the sound
Of your body breaking
As I take you down

Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside

In the darkest hole

Not to plan my funeral before the
Body dies

37,Hate To Feel ,"What's gone wrong, I can't see straight
Been too long, so full of hate

 What the fuck will it take
 Drown myself in my wake
 Another shaggy D.A.
 Now a dog, shake my leg
 Plastic man, paper face
 Candy heart, what a waste
 Gotta change, set a date
 Eat my cake, lick my plate

 Stare at me with empty eyes and
 Point your words at me
 Mirror on the wall will show you
 What you're scared to see

 I can see, yeah - (wish I couldn't see at all)
 I can feel - (wish I couldn't feel at all)
 Hate to see - (wish I couldn't see at all)
 Hate to feel - (wish I couldn't feel at all)

 So climb walls,
 Thin my blood now
 And I crawl, back to bed now

 What the hell, gotta rest
 Aching pain in my chest
 Lucky me, now I'm set
 Little bug for a pet
 New Orleans, gotta get
 Pin cushion medicine
 Used to be curious
 Now the shit's sustenance

 All this time I swore I'd never
 Be like my old man
 What the hey it's time to face
 Exactly what I am

 I can see, yeah - (wish I couldn't see at all)
 I can feel - (wish I couldn't feel at all)
 Hate to see - (wish I couldn't see at all)

Just one more time

 So crazy, beat the strain
 Too lazy, shake the gray
 So, and she willed the rain
 So let me be defamed

 Untangle you from me

 Time to call the doggies off
 Tired of the shadowin'
 Slide me to the side again
 Slapped in the face again

 Slapped in the face again

 One day my plane leaves
 Some way my head creeps
 Some day my head leads
 Some way my head creeps

 No more time
 Just one more time

 Empty room sets the scene
 Pick at me slow, pain fiend
 Suck me through barbed screen
 Anger becomes our queen
 Tongue whipping forked black
 How long until you crack
 Surprised and set back
 Lackeys' loose talk for fact

 Time to call the doggies off
 Tired of the shadowin'
 Slide me to the side again
 Slapped in the face again

 One day my plane leaves
 Some way my head creeps
 Some day my head leads
 Some way my head creeps
 Creeps

 No more time
 Just one more time

 So crazy feel the hate
 Yeah, I've got years to wait
 I know it's not too late
 Lending clean hands of fate
 Rise from the dirt I'm in
 Hide in another's skin
 Stick black dress doll with pin
 Your mouth takes on my grin

 So crazy"

41,Hollow ,"Turning in circles, slowing down
Pulling against a closing out
Easy to feed off a weaker thing
Harder to say what I really mean

Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold, blue sky

All of your colors turn to grey
Don’t even matter anyway
Bleeding impressions where you were tied
Can’t really say how you lost your mind

Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold
Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold, blue sky

Silence, so loud,
Silence, I can’t tell my up from down
Silence, so loud
Silence, I can’t tell my up from down

All of the faces life can show
Withered and ugly the one you know

Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold, blue sky

Silence, so loud
Silence, I can’t tell my up from down
Silence, so loud 
Silence, I can’t tell my up from down"
42,Hung On A Hook ,"Hung on a hook I'm a mirror
Cracked down the center I split you
Counting the clouds in a storm behind your eyes

Show you the face of a man who
Not that he wants but he has to
Look at the thing he's become, what I see

I'm caught in a still life with no frame
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change

Give up awaiting someday
Future between a gun and your head

Pieces of me on a tile floor
Look up at you as you change more
Floating in fear I appear a hundred times

Hold a reflection inside me
I cannot feel you are empty
Throw me away
I am broken not your time

I'm caught in a still life with no frame
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change

Give up awaiting someday
Future between a gun and your head

Not gonna save you
Perform euthanasia"
43,"Hush, Hush ","Alice in chains she's had on all her life
She hit the ground, cut down from a broken home

There's a better way than that
You don't have to live this way

Hush, hush
Hear me, don't you cry
You know, there's a better way
Oh no...
Hush, hush

Alice in chains she's had on all her life
but now she's broken them

Wipe away the tears

There's no excuses for who you are
You can be who you wanna be
Don't be afraid to break the chains

Screamin' sweat and bare feet to the floor
In my life, I'd not soften
Things that cut, and burn so often
But I sit, think of somethin'
Scared to face, the dyin' nothin'

See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore

Where I go is when I feel I'm able
How I fight is why I'm feelin' sore
In my sight, not forgotten
Feel as though, a tooth were rotten
Behind the smile, a tongue that's slippin'
Buzzards cry, when flesh is rippin'

See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore

Here I sit writing on the paper
Trying to think of words you can't ignore
In my eyes, what I'm lacking
Score at face, a ten for slacking
Sign the deal, set in motion
Smaller fish, so huge the ocean

See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore"

And I do it a lot

Seems so sick to the hypocrite norm
Running their boring drills

Are you happy? I am, man.

Content and fully aware
Money, status, nothing to me
'Cause your life is empty and bare

What's my drug of choice?
Well, what have you got?
I don't go broke
And I do it a lot
I do it a lot, yeah

You can't understand a user's mind

to be where I have been
To sit with elders of the gentle race,
this world has seldom seen
They talk of days for which they sit and wait, 
all will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace,
sounds caress my ears
But not a word I heard could I relay
the story was quite clear
Ohh oh
Ohh oh oh

Oooh, baby I've been flying
No, yeah, Mama, there ain't no denyin'
Oooh yeah, I've been flying, 
Mama, mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin'

All I see turns to brown, 
as the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand, 
as I scan this wasted land
Tryin' to find....Tryin' to find where I've been.

Oh, pilot of the storm that leaves no trace, 
like thoughts inside a dream
Heed the path that led me to that place, 
yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon,
I will return again
Like the dust that lufts high in June,
when moving through Kashmir.

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails, 
across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face,
along the straits of fear

55,Lab Monkey ,"Anybody out there?
Anyone at all?
Can you finally hear this deep in 
Scratching through the wall?

Came far to find me
Down the rabbit hole 
Watch me smiling back while
Chewing on the skull

I know
Won't forget 
Limped away
From the wreck

Is the monkey breathing?
Looking kinda sick 
Got a witty comment for me?
Have yourself a kick! 

Does it make you feel good?
Are you full and strong?
Gonna end up in this cage and
I hope your stay is long

I know
Won't forget 
Limped away
From the wreck

We'll never know what this is 
'Till we take a look inside
I'm sure we'll find what came before it dies

We'll never know what this is 
'Till we take a look inside
I'm sure we'll find what came before

Had enough, I don't need you to stick my hide
Had enough, no more tears for me left to cry
Had enough, I don't need you to blind my eyes
Had enough, no more tears for me left to cry

I know
Won't forget
Limped away
From the wreck

We'll never know what this is

56,Last Of My Kind ,"So young so brazen so unholy
I come to you in painted skies
Your broken saint, your ancient story
The living challenge to their lies

Trapped in the cold outside
There ain't no shelter
They wanna force my hand
Until I...

Take what I wanted, and
Break all the lies that they
Feed, the fuckin' liars...
Smash all the temples, and
Crawl through the rubble, and
Cry to the fallen

I'm the last of my kind still standing
I'm the last of my kind still standing down the law...

A wolf alone upon the hillside
I live on what they throw away
I go to sleep behind the eight ball
I live to fight for one more day

I'm trapped in the cold outside
There ain't no shelter
They wanna force my hand
'Til I...

Take what I wanted, and
Break all the lies that they
Feed, the fucking liars...
Smash all the temples, and
Crawl through the rubble, and
Cry to the fallen

I'm the last of my kind still standing
I'm the last of my kind still standing down the law...

Last of my kind still standing...
Last of my kind still standing..."
57,Lesson Learned ,"Just another lesson learned
Wear a scar, a bore repeating
Take a simple fateful turn
Opened up to stop the bleeding

Feeling like you never could
Been the disconnected frying
Hit the vein & struck a nerve
Seeing through a self that's blinding

Nowhere to buy in
Most of us hiding
Others are shining

You know when you find it
In your darkest hour, you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all

Just another lesson learned...

Just another brick you toss
Stone the number one deceiver
Multiply the added cost
Easy to become a believer

I tried to own you I thought I would 
I want to peel the skin from your face 
Before the real you lays to waste 

You told me I'm the only one 
Sweet little angel you should have run 
Lying, crying, dying to leave 
Innocence creates my hell 

Cheating myself still you know more 
It would be so easy with a whore 
Try to understand me little girl 
My twisted passion to be your world 

Lost inside my sick head 
I live for you but I'm not alive 
Take my hand before I kill 
I still love you but I still burn 

Love, hate, love"
61,Low Ceiling ,"Old mister fun is back 
Wonder where he's been hiding at 
Hanging round the edge 
Walls unfortified, inside 

No different, patchwork hack 
Toil away on an unlaid track 
Falls closing in, got nowhere to hide 
This time 

Finding ceilings low 
I'm too big or this room's too small 
Why's my ceiling another's floor

Past twisted, expected warp 
Attention span increasingly short 
Hard to breathe, this altitude will get you high 
I've tried 

Finding ceilings low 
I'm too big or this room's too small 
Why's my ceiling another's floor

And nobody can tell you
It's a moment in time 
That defines and deforms you 

Finding ceilings low 
I'm too big or this room's too small 
Why's my ceiling another's floor 

And nobody can tell you 
It's your moment in time 

Write me over, false reporter 
Can't you let me shine 
Write me over, false reporter 
Can't you let me shine 

And nobody can tell you

That defines and deforms you"
62,Lying Season ,"There's no reason
To deny
It's the season
Of the lie

Having someone
Grin at you
Look at little fingers
Pointing truth

Man it's a weight on my mind
And that's fine
But now we wade past the point of decline
There's no time

I'm a believer
In the new
Past receiver
All come true

Look to the east
Filled with hate
Neutral flashers
While we wait

Man it's a weight on my mind
And that's fine
But now we wade past the point of decline
There's no time

I'm an old lover
You're so sane
Who's the answer
Of what I mean

In this ocean
I fell into
Break me out of
The shell I grew

Man it's a weight on my mind
And that's fine
But now we wade past the point of decline
There's no time

There's no time

Buried in my shit

I'm the dog who gets beat
Shove my nose in shit

64,Maybe ,"Long gone the days of summer
In L.A. it stretches longer
Fading, waiting
Try to heal but the pain it won't go
Start with less always seems to cost more
Hating, breaking

Remember, come December
One day can last forever
Ain't nowhere that's safe for a lowly pretender
I'm shooting straight for the target center

Maybe you should know
I'm feeling lonely and I'm tired, oh yeah
Maybe I should go
Got no desire to watch the last tear fall
Maybe this will show
I'm reeling, empty, uninspired, oh yeah
Maybe I don't know
You anymore and I'm smiling
Our burden is untied
Let it die

I'd be lying if I said it felt right
Even though I got a dog in this fight
Wounded, losing
People talk, in and out the words go
To be the one from where the wind it does blow
Hounded, surrounded

Remember, come December
One life can live forever
Ain't nowhere that's safe for a lowly pretender
I'm shooting straight for the target center

Maybe you should know
I'm feeling lonely and I'm tired, oh yeah

65,Never Fade ,"Silent grieve
Suffocates the room
Feel my breathing
Speed up at the thought of you
My inner voice
Seems to want me dead
Only choice
Manage down the trail I’ve lead

Never far away I always see you
When it all goes dark you light my way through

Never fade
I know you think you’re someone I forgot
Never fade
I’m everything you really think I’m not
Never fade
I know you think you’re someone I forgot
Never fade

Growing cold
Try to numb my feeling
Lose control
All my friends are leaving
Paid the price
For all the lies I used to live
Sacrifice
For all the love I tried to give

Never far away I always see you
When it all goes dark you light my way through

Never fade
I know you think you’re someone I forgot
Never fade
I’m everything you really think I’m not

Hits me all so cold

Hands are bruised from 
Breaking rocks all day

If I don't dig my own way out I'll die here 

Gave my loyalty too soon 
Now the forked-tongue piper's bill is due 

Weather is shifting
So cold going numb
Through a pinhole of light I see vultures circling

Bottom feeders pick my skin 
Weathered brain a parasite within

Ego pulverized 
No better medicine 
Angels have been advised 
Don't want no requiem 

I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb 
I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb 
Gonna wear you like a second skin 
I'll haunt you like a phantom limb

Getting harder to breathe

Still so much worse lies ahead for you

Finding no pleasant changes
In old enemies
Not a lead a bit part playing
In my story

Once a favored son
I'm pretty done
Slap me 'round for fun

I don't care to further amuse you
Never had you how, could I lose you?
Paid in full, I owe no one at all

I'm supposed to smile and ignore it
Better than some
High roads are far to fall from
Already hung

I'm pretty done
Once a favored son

Slap me 'round for fun

Pushing towards hopeless mission
Curiosity, omission
History colored since the fall

I excuse myself, I'm used to my little cell
I amuse myself, in my very own private hell

Lately I'm beside myself
Pretending, unconcerned
Standing at a corner
Where I threw you on a turn

I'll move on... uh huh

Mark an ending scene
Damn it all if blood you spill 
Turn the grass more green

Life is short... uh huh

When I die 

Was it something I said, held against me? 
Ain't no life on the run, slowly climbing 
Caught in ice so she stares, stares at nothing 
I can help her but won't, now she hates me 

Did she call my name? 
I think it's gonna rain 
Oh, when I die 

She won't let me hide 
She don't want me to cry 

Will she keep on the ground, trying to ground me 
Slowly forgive my lie, lying to save me 
Could she love me again, or will she hate me

Thinkin' it over
It's raining down, and somehow you know

It reminds me why I even care anymore
You can find me writhing in the ghost of a song
Rising through the Rainier fog

Some people change, sometimes you leave how it oughta be
Find a new way to come clean, let it wash over me
My see-through heart like Eurythane
Beats for you proud, up down and through all the love and pain

You'd never know a long time ago you were crowning
Thinkin' it over
It's raining down, and somehow you know

It reminds me why I even care anymore
You can find me writhing in the ghost of a song
Rising through the Rainier fog

Left me here so all alone, only for me to find
Hear your voice on waves we rode, echoes inside my mind
Disembodied just a trace of what it was like then
With you here we shared a space that's always half empty

Grinding, grinding on
Always half empty
Grinding, grinding on
Always half empty

So we can laugh it's inside, never hear me complain
My see-through city of cellophane
You'd never know a long time ago you were drowning
Thinking it over
It's raining down, and somehow you know

It reminds me why I even care anymore

So the people will know
That the rush hour is now
On the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down
Upon the sacred cow.

Ring them bells, ring them bells!
Ring them bells, ring them bells!

Ring them bells Sweet Martha,

You gotta ring them bells so the world will know
That God is one.
For the shepherd is asleep
Where the willows weep
And the mountains are filled
With little lost sheep.

Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through.
Ring them bells, for the time that flies,
For the child that cries
When innocence dies.

Ring them bells St. Catherine
From the top of the room,
Now ring them bells from the fortress
For the lilies in bloom.
For the lines, they are all long
And the fighting is strong
And they're breaking down the distance
Between right and wrong.

Ring them bells, ring them bells!
Ring them bells, ring them bells!"
82,Rooster ,"Ain't found a way to kill me yet
Eyes burn with stinging sweat
Seems every path leads me to nowhere
Wife and kids household pet
Army green was no safe bet
The bullets scream to me from somewhere

Here they come to snuff the rooster
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no, ya know he ain't gonna die

Walkin' tall machine gun man
They spit on me in my home land
Gloria sent me pictures of my boy
Got my pills 'gainst mosquito death
My buddy's breathin' his dyin' breath
Oh God please won't you help me make it through

Here they come to snuff the rooster 
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah 
You know he ain't gonna die 
No, no, no ya know he ain't gonna die"

I'm breaking without a sound
Bits and pieces of trying
Get what you pay for, nothing

Frozen dreaming of yesterday
Potent, creeping I'm far away
From my hometown I lit out
To save my skin and shed some doubt

I know how false the floor
How high the sky
Been down that road before

It's a lie, you hide in someone else
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself

Hard as truth is, been my friend
Don't need to be invited in
I'll go round 'til bested
Pick up myself and try again

I know how false the floor
How high the sky
Been down that road before

It's a lie, you hide in someone else
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself

All comes in time
Don't fight it, don't mind it

Such a crime 

You opened fire... And your mark was true 
You opened fire... Aim my smilin' skull at you 
You opened fire... 

I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow

Lines cut across my face 
Why you laugh at my disgrace 
I'll never know 
How far to go 
To reach that place

Thousand eyes, a fly
Lucky then I'd be
In one day deceased

Sickman, sickman, sickman

I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer
When my thoughts become my biggest fear

Ah, what's the difference, I'll die
In this sick world of mine

What the hell am I?
Leper from inside
Inside wall of peace
Dirty and diseased

Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman

I can see the end is getting near
I won't rest until my head is clear

Ah, what's the difference, I'll die
In this sick world of mine

Can you see the end?
Choke on me my friend
Must to drown these thoughts
Purity over rot

""Yeah, though I walk through the valley of rape and despair
With head high and eyes alert
I tread on a plane of many
We who are of good nature and intention,
But cannot touch on the dark
Recesses of memory
And pain learned, so come walk
With me, feel the pain,
And release it...""
What the hell am I?
Worn eroded pride
Saddened 10 miles wide
I'm gonna let it slide

89,Sludge Factory ,"You insult me in my home, you're forgiven this time
Things go well, your eyes dilate, you shake, and I'm high?
Look in my eyes deep and watch the clouds change with time
20 hours won't print my picture milk carton size
Carton size, carton size

Call me up congratulations ain't the real why
There's no pressure besides brilliance let's say by day 9
Endless corporate ignorance lets me control time
By the way, by the way, by the way

Once again you see an in, discolored skin gives you away
So afraid you kindly gurgle, out a date for me

Now the body of one soul I adore wants to die
You have always told me you'd not live past 25
I say stay long enough to repay all who cause strife

Once again you see an in, discolored skin gives you away 
So afraid you kindly gurgle, out a date for me

""I bear true and an existing witness
to this barrel of monkeys.
A self proclaimed immoral success,
perfected by each whereof
individually deadly and equally so
and spread about the surrendered troops,
for even thousands of miles will not
tear apart their communication, or the lack thereof.
Vultures, liars, thieves, each proclaim their innocence
In no suggestion or rhyme, your weapon is contained in
the wrecking of the keeping the desired effect.
The breaking of the spirit thwarts the whole being.
Your weapon is guilt, your weapon is guilt, your weapon is guilt.

So far under
Far I've never fell
Now forever dwell
So far under

Too much pain to tell

Have a guess I don't let you look inside
Cold, dry, stone

What makes you want to carve your initials in me?
Rained and weathered erasing hard to read
Find me distant, outwardly rough obscene
Cold, dry, stone
Cold and dry, a stone
Cold and dry, a stone

I'm not a cornerstone in a palace for you
Time will bring your very own hard truth
Not to worry, ice covered rocks still move
Cold, dry, stone,
Cold, dry, stone."

Then I heard a voice
Said `Son you have a choice`
I then slapped my face

Let me be, I`m okay
I`m awake anyway
It`s too bright over here
I can shift, cannot steer
So I drive them away
For a while, then I stay

In a bodiless embrace
Thriving I have grown
Fickle changing grip replaced
Choking take it all

Dedicated, true to form
Still the only one
Only guarantee
Continue after I am done

You before things had changed
In a compass, I ride
All this feels rearranged


Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone?
Shifting to the after
An impostor, I'm not the one you know


I look the same outside
Nearly me even though
I carry something I hide
Underneath the one you know


Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone?
Shifting to the after
An impostor, so disowned

Are you surprised black water flows
From wells run dry?
I'm not the one you know




Lay me out with our guilt
Watch the explosions fall, rain
Cannot live within this tilt
Carryin' over
I'm not the one you know


Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone?
Shifting to the after
An impostor, so disowned

Are you surprised black water flows
From wells run dry?
I'm not the one you know
I'm not the one you know"

Watch the blood float in the muddy sewer
Take another hit
And bury your brother

Black inside

No one plans to take the path that brings you lower
And here you stand before us all and say it's over
It's over

It might seem an afterthought
Yes it hurts to know you're bought
