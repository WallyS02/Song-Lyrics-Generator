0,(Beginning Of What's About To Happen) ,"In the middle of the Highway, 
As you ride down the road, 
Just get that feeling, 
It's all so black and bald. 
And then theres my face, 
When you're drivin the desert sand, 
Well open my hand, 
Well open up the land. 

Yeah. 

Well everyone now bring your car to me. 
From the mother of earth to the depth of the sea. 
Well dont raise any hand for me, 
When ya na na na na need me.

1,100' ,"Step on it,
I beg you please,
Jus' 100' I'm on my knees,
It's the one you blow,
It's the one you show,
So then you know I'm right


There's been a place built for you,
Sit by the fire tell, me truths,
Don't blind my eyes turn them blue,
And then I'll dry my face on you

Step on,
I beg you please,
Jus' 100' so I freeze,
Drowning in that ice I fly,
It's a great white place,
And the heat's diseased

2,50 Million Year Trip (Upside Down) ,"I am drinking 
I am rolling (you can't stop me)

But I'll never forget you (anyway) 
But I'll never forget you (anyway) 
But I'll never forget you 

I am drinking 
I am rolling (you can't stop me) 
I am running

But I'll never forget you anyway 
But I'll never forget you anyway

As it's running down today 
I love the city love the day 

No fool for you 
In this I am 
I'm never gonna run about"

23,Into the Void ,"Rocket engines burning fuel so fast 
Up into the night sky they blast 
Through the universe the engines whine 
Could it be the end of man and time 
Back on earth the flame of life burns low 
Everywhere is misery and woe 
Pollution kills the air, land, and sea 
Man prepares to meet his destiny 

Rocket engines burning fuel so fast 
Up into the black sky so vast 
Burning metal through the atmosphere 
Earth remains in worry, hate and fear 
With the hateful battles raging on 
Rockets flying to the glowing sun 
Through the empires of eternal void 
Freedom from the final suicide 

Freedom fighters sent out to the sun 
Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution 
Leave the earth to all its sin and hate 
Find another world where freedom waits 

Past the stars in fields of ancient void 
Through the shields of darkness where they find 
Love upon a land a world unknown 
Where the sons of freedom make their home 
Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves 
Leave them to their future in their grave 
Make a home where love is there to stay 
Peace and happiness in every day "

Once you return from the belly of the beast
You're never quite the same

Shut it, shut it on

And it rages out of control
The fire inside the belly of the beast
Well it burns, then wraps your soul

Shut it, shut it on
Shut it, shut it on"

God damn son of a bitch."
36,Space Cadet ,"I'm standing alone on the cliffs of the world. 
No one ever tends to me. 
Sitting alone, covered in rays. 
Some things are so my mind can breath 

Waiting is hard 
Fucking takes so long 
Draped in sun - hands in sand 
Earth acid cleanses me, cleanses me clean 
But the world, it never comes 

It never comes 
It never comes 
It never comes 

I lay on my side in the edge of the room 
She never expects anything from me 
When all the days - the days of the year 
I know I miss that part of me. 

Waiting is hard 
Fucking takes so long 
Draped in sun, hands in sand 
Earth acid cleanses me, cleanses me clean 
But the world it never comes 

It never comes 
It never comes

It never comes 
It never comes"

46,Window Of Souls ,"
Two worlds separate us 
I'm alone and waiting - 
Waiting for you 
Little princess 
Come by my side 
Come around 
Come around to me 
Endless waiting for you 
Time has held me back no more 
End is waiting for you 
No one can keep me from you 
My life long dream 
Come to me for sure 
Vowed eternal soul 
Now envelope me... 
I offer thee all... 
All for you 
Soul stealer, it's time to be 
Spirit away now... "
47,Writhe ,"Everyone seems to be singing for Satan 
Guess I will to. 
What a joke, 
You make me laugh, 
Till I turn blue. 

Any tailor's out to ware, 
What a menhir looking crew. 
I don't think I'll tease my hair, 
I'd rather sit here teasing you. 

Won't you writhe like snakes down on the floor 
Out you go and he done one hundred and more. 

I seem to've lost my cowboy boots 
with the fringe runnin' down the side 
my sewing machine has made me green 
'cuz my jeans didn't turn out tight 

And all these ruins I took for you, 
you keep my limit alive. 
Your smile rolls away for miles, 
and your kiss makes it worth the ride. "
