0,Hole In The Sky,"



I'm looking through a hole in the sky
I'm seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie
I'm getting closer to the end of the line
I'm living easy where the sun doesn't shine

I'm living in a room without any view
I'm living free because the rent's never due
The synonym of all the things that I've said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head

Hole in the sky
Gateway to heaven
Window in time
Through it I'll fly

I've seen the stars that disappear in the sun
But shooting's easy if you've got the right gun
And even though I'm sitting waiting for Mars
I don't believe there's any future in cars

Hole in the sky
Gateway to heaven
Window in time
Through it I'll fly

I've watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast
I've seen the western world go down in the east
The food of love became the greed of our time
And now we're living on the profits of crime

1,Symptom Of The Universe,"



Take me through the centuries to supersonic years
Electrifying enemy is drowning in his tears
All I have to give you is a love that never dies
The symptom of the universe is written in your eyes

Yeah

Mother Moonâshe's calling me back to her silver womb
Father of creation takes me from my stolen tomb
Seventh Advent unicorn is waiting in the skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies

Yeah

Take my hand, my child of love, come step inside my tears
Swim the magic ocean I've been crying all these years
With our love we'll ride away into eternal skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies

Yeah

Woman, child of love's creation, come and step inside my dreams
In your eyes I see no sadness, you are all that loving means
Take my hand and we'll go riding through the sunshine from above
We'll find happiness together in the summer skies of love

2,Megalomania,"



I hide myself inside the shadows of shame
The silent symphonies were playing their game
My body echoed to the dreams of my soul
It started something that I could not control

Where can I run to now?
The joke is on me
No sympathizing God, it's insanity

Why don't you just get out of my life?
Why don't you just get out of my life now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone?

Obsessed with fantasy, possessed with my schemes
I mixed reality with pseudo-god dreams
The ghost of violence was something I'd seen
I sold my soul to be the human obscene

How could this poison be the dream of my soul
How did my fantasies take complete control?

Why don't you just get out of my life?
Why don't you just get out of my life now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone now?
Why doesn't everybody leave me alone?

Well I feel something's taking me I don't know where
It's like a trip inside a separate mind
The ghost of tomorrow from my favorite dream
Is telling me to leave it all behind

Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Got to get to happiness, want no more of sorrow

How I lied, went to hide
How I tried to get away from you now
Am I right if I fight?
That I might just get away from you now

Sting me!

Well I feel something's giving me the chance to return
It's giving me the chance of saving my soul
Pictures of demigod are fading away
I'm going backwards but I'm in control

Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Getting back to sanity from the depths of sorrow

Was it wise to disguise?
How I tried to get away from you now
Is there a way that I could pay
Or is it true I have to stay with you now?

How I lied, went to hide
How I tried to get away from you now
Am I right if I fight?
That I might just get away from you now

Suck me!

I'm really digging schizophrenia the best of the earth
I'll chase my soul in the fires of hell
Peace of mind eluded me, but now it's all mine
I set the trap but it was me who fell

Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Now I've found my happiness from the depths of sorrow

No more lies, I got wise
I despise the way I worship you
Now I'm free, let me see
That now instead I won't be led by you now

Free!

3,The Thrill Of It All,"



Inclination of direction, walk the turned and twisted rift
With the children of creation futuristic dreams we sift
Clutching violently we whisper with a liquefying cry
Any deadly final answers that are surely doomed to die

Won't you help me Mr. Jesus, won't you tell me if you can?
When you see this world we live in, do you still believe in Man?
If my songs become my freedom, and my freedom turns to gold
Then I'll ask the final question, if the answer could be sold

Well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it
'Cause I've got no reason to lie, yeah
Forget your problems that don't even exist
And I'll show you a way to get high, oh yeah
Oh yeah!

So come along, you know you matter to me
Remember freedom is not hard to find, yeah
Time to stop all your messing around
Don't you think that I know my own mind, oh yeah
Oh yeah!

Why can't you believe, it's not here to perceive
Do you always have to be told, yeah
For you have been taught that if your mind has been bought
Life's entire answer was sold, oh yeah
Oh yeah!

4,Am I Going Insane (Radio),"



Everybody's looking at me, feeling paranoid inside
When I step outside I feel free, think I'll find a place to hide
Tell me people, am I going insane?
Tell me people, am I going insane?

Every day I sit and wonder how my life it used to be
Now I feel like going under, now my life is hard to see
So tell me people, am I going insane?
Tell me people, am I going insane?

So I'm telling all you people, listen while I sing again
If I don't sound very cheerful, I think that I'm a schizophrene
So tell me people, am I going insane?
Tell me people, am I going insane?


"
5,The Writ,"



The way I feel is the way I am
I wish I'd walked before I started to run to you
Just to you

What kind of people do you think we are?
Another joker who's a rock and roll star for you
Just for you

The hateful image of another man
The endless ocean of emotion I swam for you
Yeah for you

The shock troopers laying down on the floor
I wish theyâd fallen into my private war with you
Yeah with you

Are you devil, are you man
Youâve changed a lot since you began
Yeah began

Ladies digging gold from you
Will they still dig now you're through
Yeah you're through

You bought and sold me with your lying words
The voices in the dark that you never heard came true
Yeah came true

Your fallen phallic god dismembered and gone
A poison father with his poisonous son, thatâs you
Yeah that's you

I beg you please don't let it get any worse
The anger I once had has turned to a curse on you
Yeah curse you

All of the promises that never came true
You're gonna get what is coming to you, that's true
Ah, that's true

Are you Satan, are you man?
You've changed a lot since it began
It began

Vultures sucking gold from you
Will they still suck now you're through

Cats, rats

The search is on, so you just better run
And find yourself another way
Rob the dead, they don't feel a thing
Leave the living for another day

Rats, rats

You are nonentity, you have no destiny
You are a figment of a thing unknown
A mental picture of a stolen soul
The fornication of your golden throne

A smiling face, it means the world to me
So tired of sadness and of misery

My life it started some time ago
Where it will end, I don't know
I thought I was so good
I thought I was smart
I feel my world is torn apart

But everything is gonna work out fine
If it don't I think I'll lose my mind

I know, I know, I know, yeah yeah I know
Listen to me while I sing this song
You might just think the words are wrong
Too many people advising me
But they don't know what my eyes see

But everything is gonna work out fine
If it don't I feel I'll blow my mind

6,Blow On A Jug,"



Blow on a Jug
Everybody come on - blow on a jug
Be like me and blow on a jug
I want you to blow on a jug
Everybody begin - blow on a jug
