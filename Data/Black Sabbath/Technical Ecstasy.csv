0,Back Street Kids,"



I'm just another back street kid
Rock 'n Roll music is the only thing I really dig
Can't stop the music going round inside my head
I'm a rock 'n roll soldier, gonna play it until I'm dead
Nobody I know will ever take my rock 'n roll away from me

Sitting in the back seat of a shiny limousine
Living in a taxi can't remember where I've been
Playing my music, sitting in my hotel room
Writing about the stars and thinking about the hand of doom
Nobody I know will ever take my rock 'n roll away from me

Living life comes easy if you know which way you're going
Got to see yourself in others' eyes, surprised?
Living like I want to don't come easy, but I'm trying
Sorting out what's true and what are lies, it's wise

Brought up in a back street living with the salt of the land
Seems that now my music's paying off my tax demands
So listen to the music, want to see you getting so high
'Cause I'm a back street rocker and I will be till the day I die
Nobody I know will ever take my rock 'n roll away from me

1,You Won't Change Me,"



I'm just a man and I am what I am, yeah
Nobody will ever change my ways
I don't need money and I don't need no lies, yeah
I only need to live for today
But I'd like to talk things over with you
I want to hear the things you say, today
Although you won't change me anyway, oh no way

I wish you'd come and see me, I'd like to hold you
I want to set my mind all free
You understand me woman, you give me time, yeah
But I don't need no sympathy
Still I wonder what it's like to be loved
Instead of hiding in myself
Nobody will change me anyway, no no way

Nobody's gonna change my world
That's something too unreal
Nobody will change the way I feel

So listen to me now, hear what I say, yeah
Please give me time and maybe love
If there's a God up there, well I hope he helps me
I need him now to set me free
'Cause it may be that it's over for me
If you don't hear the things that I say, today
Nobody will change me anyway, no no way

Nobody's gonna change my world
That's something too unreal
Nobody will change the way I feel

2,It's Alright,"



Told you once about your friends and neighbours
They were always seeking but they'll never find it
It's alright, yes it's alright

Where to go and where to see
It's always been that way and it can never be
It's alright, yes it's alright

Give it all and ask for no return
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn
That's it's alright, yes it's alright

Don't you know that it's so good for you
You can be making love and see it all go through
But it's alright, yes it's alright


"
3,Gypsy,"



Watching the universe at the end of another day
Fatalistic ships form a distant shore
In the back of my mind I could see she was standing there
Like the feeling you have
When you've been there before

She was a gypsy woman
She was as cold as the day, yeah
She said I'd got it coming
And then she took me away, yeah

She took me through the shadows of her sunken dream
I thought it's over me, she wasn't all she seemed

She took my hand and then she started to speak
She told me she'd had the call
With eyes of fire that were burning my soul
She looked into her crystal ball
She read my fortune then she read my mind
She didn't like my thoughts at all

She showed me shadows, a spectre of life
My soul just wanted to scream
She stared so deeply into my eyes
That's when I fell into a dream
When I awoke in bed she lay beside me
And she read me with her eyes, she said

So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now
So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now, now, now

Gypsy woman you're the devil in drag
You are the queen of all hell
You took my body, now you're wasting my soul
You've got me under your spell
And as the sun shines on another day
You're gonna take my mind as well, it's over

So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now
So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now
So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now
So you wanna be a gypsy

4,All Moving Parts (Stand Still),"



Super animation, turning on a nation
And they're saying all moving parts stand still
Since he was elected, adrenalin injected
Hear him saying all moving parts should kill
Just like the hero he's got them all on the run
Yes he's won, yeah

Since he passed the motion, they're building in the ocean
And he's saying all men should be free
What a combination, peace and radiation
And he's saying free men should fight for me
Just like his momma, he seems to get his pleasure from pain
And the rain, ain't that strange?
Very strange, yeah

I like choking toys
You've got to see me before you meet the boys
Teacher's burnt the school
He's had enough of sticking to the rules, alright

People stop and see
He's got to be more decadent than me
Just to pass the time
He gets his kicks from licking off the wine

Pretty silly ladies, all Cynthia's and Sadie's
Call him and he takes their numbers down
Says he is a woman, I should have seen it coming
And she's saying she's married to a clown
Just like a lady she'll keep you guessing through the night
Not tonight, well I might, oh alright, yeah

5,Rock 'N' Roll Doctor,"



Well I'm sick and tired of hearing 'bout the world and it's hang ups
Gonna get myself together, take a ride downtown
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see him, see him today
He's gonna blow me away

He makes me happy when I'm feeling down
Take away my worry takes away my frown
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see him, see him today
He gonna blow me away

If you wanna feel groovy
Give the doctor a call, yeah
Doctor rock will help you anytime at all
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see my Rock'n'Roll doctor
Gotta see him, see him today
He gonna blow me away
Oh, right away...

6,She's Gone,"



I've been gone a long long time - waiting for you
I didn't want to see you go, oh, no, no
And now it's hurting so much, what can I do?
I wanted you to be my wife

The days are passing slowly, since you've gone
Your memories are all I have, yes I have
I sit here waiting but you'll never show
Without you I can't carry on, ooh my baby

You said you'd always love me, all of my life
And then you said your last goodbye, yeah, goodbye
Why the sudden change, why all the lies?
I should have seen it in your eyes

The endless hours of heartache, waiting for you
My summer love has turned to rain, all the pain
The silent emptiness of one sided love
My life means nothing now you're gone, ooh my baby


"
7,Dirty Women,"



The neon lights are shining on me again
I walk the lonely streets in search of a friend
I need a lady to help me to get through the night, through the night
If I could find one then everything would be alright

The sleepy city is dreaming the night time away
Out on the street I watch tomorrow becoming today
I see a man, he's got take away women for sale, yes for sale
Guess that's the answer, 'cause take away women don't fail

Oh dirty women, they don't mess around
Oh dirty women, they don't mess around
You've got me coming, You've got me going around
Oh dirty women, they don't mess around

Walking the streets I wonder will it ever happen
Gotta be good 'cause then everything will be OK
If I could score tonight then I will end up happy

A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day...
