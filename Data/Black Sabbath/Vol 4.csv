0,Wheels Of Confusion / The Straightener,"



Long ago I wandered through my mind
In the land of fairy tales and stories
Lost in happiness I knew no fears
Innocence and love was all I knew
It was an illusion

Soon the days were passing into years
Happiness just didn't come so easy
Life was more than fairy tales and daydreams
Innocence was just another word
It was an illusion

Lost in the wheels of confusion
Running through valleys of tears
Eyes full of angry delusion
Hiding in everyday fears

So I found that life is just a game
But you know there's never been a winner
Try your hardest, you'll still be a loser
The world will still be turning when you're gone
Yeah when you're gone!


"
1,Tomorrow's Dream,"



Well I'm leaving tomorrow at daybreak
Catch the fastest train around nine
Yes I'm leaving the sorrow and heartache
Before it takes me away from my mind

Send me love and I may let you see me
Send me hopes that can spin in my head
But if you really want me to answer
I can only let you know when I'm dead

When sadness fills my days
It's time to turn away
And then tomorrow's dreams
Become reality to me

So realize I'm much better without you
You're not the one and only thing in my heart
I'll just go back to pretending I'm living
So this time I'm gonna have to depart


"
2,Changes,"



I feel unhappy
I feel so sad
I lost the best friend
That I ever had

She was my woman
I loved her so
But it's too late now
I've let her go

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

We shared the years
We shared each day
In love together
We found a way

But soon the world
Had its evil way
My heart was blinded
Love went astray

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

It took so long
To realize
That I can still hear
Her last goodbyes

Now all my days
Are filled with tears
Wish I could go back
And change these years

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

3,Supernaut,"



I want to reach out and touch the sky
I want to touch the sun
But I don't need to fly
I'm gonna climb up every mountain of the moon
And find the dish that ran away with the spoon

I've crossed the ocean, turned every bend
I found the crossing near a golden rainbow's end
I've been through magic and through life's reality
I've lived a thousand years and it never bothered me

Got no religion, don't need no friends
Got all I want and I don't need to pretend
Don't try to reach me, 'cause I'd tear up your mind
I've seen the future and I've left it behind


"
4,Snowblind,"



What you get and what you see
Things that don't come easily
Feeling happy in my vein
Icicles are in my brain

Something blowing in my hair
Winter's ice, it soon was dead
Death would freeze my very soul
Makes me happy, makes me cold

My eyes are blind, but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the tree
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel there's no place freezing me

Let the winter sun shine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Fill my dreams with flakes of snow
Soon I'll feel the chilling go

Don't you think I know what I'm doing
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong
You're the one that's really the loser
This is where I feel I belong

Crystal world with winter flowers
Turn my days to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?


"
5,Cornucopia,"



Too much in the truth they say
Keep it 'till another day
Let them have their little game
Illusion helps to keep them sane

Let them have their little toys
Fast sports cars and motor noise
Exciting in their plastic place
Frozen food in a concrete maze

You're gonna go insane
I'm trying to save your brain

I don't know what's happening
My head's all torn inside
People say I'm heavy
They don't know what I hide

Take a life, it's going cheap
Kill someone, no one will weep
Freedom's yours, just pay your dues
We just want your soul to use

You're gonna go insane
I'm trying to save your brain


"
6,St. Vitus' Dance,"



So you think you know
What's going on inside her head
You think she wants your money
But it's you she wants instead

When you think about the things
That she did long ago
It breaks your heart but deep down
Boy, you don't want her to go

You really look so shattering
You feel you want to die
Just because of the one mistake
Of telling you a lie

If I were you I'd try again
And try and make amends
She only thinks of you, you know
I'm talking as a friend


"
7,Under The Sun / Every Day Comes & Goes,"



Well I don't want no Jesus freak to tell me what it's all about
No black magician telling me to cast my soul out
Don't believe in violence, I don't even believe in peace
I've opened the door, now my mind's been released

Well I don't want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No I don't want no one to tell me where I'm gonna go when I die
I wanna live my life, I don't want people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself, 'cause no one else is true

Every day just comes and goes
Life is one long overdose
People try to rule the nation
I just see through their frustration

People hiding their real face
And each one's running their rat race
And behind each flower there grows a weed
In their world of make-believe

So believe what I tell you, it's the only way you'll find in the end
Just believe in yourself, you know you really shouldn't have to pretend
Don't let those empty people try and interfere with your mind
Just live your life and leave them all behind
