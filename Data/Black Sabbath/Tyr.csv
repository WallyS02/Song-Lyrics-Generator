0,Anno Mundi,"



Can you see me, are you near me?
Can you hear me crying out for life?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over you'll find the answer
Running in the whispering rain
Anno Mundi? Can you wonder!
Truth of thunder, life or blame

Do you see a vision of a perfect place?
Does it make you laugh, put a smile on your face?
Do you need a mirror, do you see it well?
Does the hand of God still toll the bell?
There are people laughing
They're all laughing on you
If only they could see what you're saying is true
Still generals fighting, making war on the world
Don't they know, don't they know?
No, no, no

[CHORUS]
The wind in the night blows cold
Your eyes are burning
As the sands of our time grow old
Anno mundi

Do you follow the path that so many tread?
Are you among the blind so easily lead?
Do you join the war, do you fight for the cause?
Depend on another to fight it alone

[CHORUS]

Can you see me now, can you hear me now?
Can you tell me, where's the glory?
Ride the days and sail the nights
When it's over, you'll find the answer
Runnin' in the rain

There's a hope that's growing and a vision too
All those angry hearts now reach out for you
Do you look to the dawn, see a new day begun?
No longer the fool, the vision is done


"
1,The Law Maker,"



The horizon breaks, where a figure stands
Close your eyes and pray it's a vision of God's command

[CHORUS]
He's evil and mysterious, people fear his name
He's not here for deliverance, no
He's the Lawmaker

He newer speaks, but his task we're told
To seek out souls of the sinners, he'll trade for gold

[CHORUS]

Silver mountains won't save you from hell
The prince of darkness inside you will dwell
Oh your weakness your past
The Lawmaker comes

[CHORUS]

He's the Lawmaker


"
2,Jerusalem,"



The highway's screamin', callin' out your name
Cause every road that you travel on
There's a price to pay
A thousands eyes are starin'
But the blind still lead the blind

[CHORUS]
Where will you turn if it all goes wrong and you're on the run
Jerusalem?

You say you walked through the valley
You say you've seen the signs
Echoes call you from a distant age
Or is it in your mind?

Then a thousands souls rise from the sea
Holding up the sun
And an angel cries beware your lies'
It could be the end of it all

[CHORUS]

Everybody knows your name, every road leads to anger
Will it always be the same, is there reason to return?

[CHORUS]

When an angel cries - Jerusalem
Better watch your lies - Jerusalem
When an angel cries - Jerusalem


"
3,The Sabbath Stones,"



Fire and water, wind and rain
Wings that carry hell in every vein
World possessions, endless tears
Truth and knowledge stolen all their years

World turns slowly, sun don't shine
Silence still the air and kills the chime
Words are poison, passion bleeds
2000 years on earth has sown the seeds

The time of dreams has turned
The night is gone and light shines on
Where darkness once would hide
With spirits high, our fears were born

[CHORUS]
Receiver of light, the kingdom of God will guide you
Keep you from a restless heart
Deceiver of night the stranger that laughs
Within you, the reason for your restless heart
Is the keeper of the Sabbath Stones

Fire and water, wind and rain
Wings that carry hell in every vein
World turns slowly, sun don't shine
Silence still the air and kills the chime

Can faith destroy desire? Each breath a prayer
Each step brings fear
The eyes of they that see have evil stare
Watch over me

[CHORUS]

And He's the keeper of the Sabbath Stones

What God is this that stands to hear his people cry?
What hand would strike and watch his people die?
What life that takes, what future did we earn?
It's our mistakes, take need the Sabbath Stones
What life that takes, what future did we earn?
It's our mistakes


"
4,Odin's Court,"



As you walk alone the night surrounds you like a shroud
The dreams you had were once of love and being proud
Misty horizons block your vision of the world
But the raven's eyes will show you all you need to know

The land you loved is now so barren and so cold
The name of God rings out so high in your soul
This time is masters will lead us by the sword
And should we fait them all prevails in Odin's court


"
5,Valhalla,"



Leading us on, to the land of Eternity
Riding the cold cold winds of Valhalla

The Kingdom of Odin is the Kingdom of Gods
Where only souls of the brave may rest in peace
But someone among them had the skill of deceit
And raised the hand that would open the road to Hell

[CHORUS]
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Be sure that the blood will start to flow
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Valhalla

The ring has been broken and a soul must be saved
Among the bravest of men, who rides to Hell
The longships are sailing and the chariots ride
And yes the anger of Thor will serve you well

[CHORUS]

Raise your hands
Reach and Valhalla will save your soul
Raise your eyes
And Odin will lead us on

They say that history repeats itself
Upon the year of the seventh Century
Well nobody knows no you never can tell
So you'd better run now and hide away

[CHORUS]


"
6,Feels Good To Me,"



The chapter is opened and the pages are turned
The writting say many things but who was concerned

Where can we run to now, when will we learn?
When it's lost gone forever

For years they told me what I should to do
Down to the places I go and who I should talk to
But that don't matter no more since I found out the truth
And it feels good to me

The world is turnin'
Forever turnin'
Forever yearnin'
For the love of life
And you're wrong if think that I'm afraid to love

I wonder, I wonder does it not seem strange to you
Just how the tables have turned on me and you?

How long can we go on livin', livin' the way we do?
When it's lost it's gone forever

It feels good to me, [etc.]


"
7,Heaven In Black,"



Rising with the sun, the work has been done
But the people are starting to stare
Called from the afar to court of the Czar
Could it be something is wrong?

You stand face to face and your heart gathers place
For the answer to a question a prize
If only you had known to be honest was wrong
For the work that you've done you will pay with your eyes

[CHORUS]
Into the black where the night
Never ends and the light
Leaves a scar on your soul
Where your heart used to hold
Your love here!
Heaven in Black

Inside there's a voice saying was there a choice
You'd still be entombed in the night
Lucifer's to blame, the reason for the flame
They've taken your sight but they'll not take your God

[CHORUS]
