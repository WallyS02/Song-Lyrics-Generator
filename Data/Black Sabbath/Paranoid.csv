0,Luke's Wall / War Pigs,"



Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh Lord yeah!

Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor, yeah

Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait till their judgment day comes, yeah!

Now in darkness world stops turning
Ashes where the bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment God is calling
On their knees the war pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan laughing spreads his wings
Oh Lord yeah

1,Paranoid,"



Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal

And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late

2,Planet Caravan,"



We sail through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs
The Moon in silver dreams
Falls down in beams
Light of the night
The Earth a purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always

While down below the trees
Bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks
Dawn from night
And so we pass on by
The crimson eye
Of great god Mars
As we travel the universe


"
3,Iron Man,"



I am Iron Man

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?

Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fill his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!


"
4,Electric Funeral,"



Reflex in the sky
Warn you you're gonna die
Storm coming, you better hide
From the atomic tide

Flashes in the sky
Turns houses into sties
Turns people into clay
Radiation minds decay

Robot minds of robot slaves
Lead them to atomic graves
Plastic flowers, melting sun
Fading moon falls upon

Dying world of radiation
Victims of man's frustration
Burning globe of obscene fire
Like electric funeral pyre

Buildings crashing down
To earth's cracking ground
Rivers turned to mud
Eyes melt into blood

Earth lies in deathbed
Clouds cry for the dead
Tearing falling rain
Ease the burning pain

Electric Funeral
Electric Funeral
Electric Funeral
Electric Funeral

And so in the sky
Shines the electric eye
Supernatural king
Takes Earth under his wing

Heaven's golden chorus sings
Hell's angels flap their wings
Evil souls fall to hell
Ever trapped in burning cell


"
5,Hand Of Doom,"



What you gonna do
Time's caught up with you
Now you wait your turn
You know there's no return

Change your empty rules
You join the other fools
Turn to something new
Now it's killing you

First it was the bomb, Vietnam napalm
Disillusioning, you push the needle in
From life you escape, reality's black drape
Colors in your mind, satisfy your time

Oh you, you know you must be blind
To do such things like this
To take the sweet that you don't know
You're giving Death a kiss
Poor little fool now

Your Mind is full of pleasure
Your body's looking ill
To you it's shallow leisure
So drop the acid pill
Don't stop to think now

You're having a good time baby
But that won't last
Your mind's all full of things
You're living too fast
Go out, enjoy yourself
Don't bottle it in
You need someone to help you
Stick the needle in, yeah

Now you know the scene
Your skin starts turning green
Your eyes no longer see life's reality
Push the needle in
Face Death's sickly grin
Holes are in your skin
Caused by deadly pin

Head starts spinning 'round
You Fall down to the ground
Feel your body heave
Death hand starts to weave

It's too late to turn
You don't want to learn
Price of life is high
Now you're gonna die

6,Fairies Wear Boots / Jack The Stripper,"



Goin' home, late last night
Suddenly I got a fright
Yeah I looked through a window and surprised what I saw
Fairy with Boots are dancing with a dwarf, alright now!

Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lie
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, well all right now!

Yeah, fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, well all right now!

So I went to the doctor to see what he could give me
He said ""Son, son, you've gone too far
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do""

Yeah
