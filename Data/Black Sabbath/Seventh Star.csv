0,In For The Kill,"



Thunder shattered the dawn
Raging with fury, the king has come
The power of terror will reign
There is no mercy in pleading
In for the kill, no quarter be shown
Live for the thrill of battle alone
Blessed by the will to die for the throne
In for the kill
In for the kill
Freedom is taken by storm
The blood on his hands is still running warm
The power of terror will reign
There is no mercy in pleading
In for the kill, no quarter be shown
Live for the thrill of battle alone
Blessed by the will to die for the throne
In for the kill
For the kill
Thunder shattered the dawn
Raging with fury, the king has come
Death and destruction riding the storm
Blood on his hands still running warm
In for the kill
The king has come

1,No Stranger To Love,"



Cold is the night
Lonely till dawn
Cry for the light
For the love that won't come
You said that you'd never
Leave me alone
I gave you my heart
You cried for my soul
An angel won't come
This devil won't go
Something is wrong
I just can't get away
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love
But I'm a stranger in your arms
Yes, I'm a stranger in your arms
Maybe it's right
But I just can't understand
The hurt that I feel
For my love second hand
I know I should leave
But I just can't walk away
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
I'm a stranger in your arms
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love

2,Turn To Stone,"



She came from the past
She was never meant to last
Her destiny was fatal
From the start
A messenger from hell
She cast a deadly spell
On all of those who dare
To cross her heart
Ain't no use in you trying to run
Fate has taken it's toll
Just one look and the damage is done
Burn your eyes
Turn your heart into stone
History foretold of a circle
Cast in gold
An evil seed of power
Sealed within
But fate has lent a hand
Destroyed the golden band
And freed her soul
To wash the land with sin
Ain't no use in you trying to run
Fate has taken it's toll
Just one look and the damage is done
Burn your eyes
Turn your heart into stone
She cast a deadly spell
She put a spell on you
She's got evil in her heart
Turn your heart into stone
Turn your heart into stone

3,Seventh Star,"



There's a vision in the sands
Rising from the ancient past
Crying let my spirit go
Lead my burning soul to rest
Hear the sound of distant ages
It's the call of the seventh star
There's no shelter from the heat
There's no mercy from this land
Hear a thousand chanting souls
Waiting judgement from God's hand
Hear the sound of distant ages
It's the call of the seventh star
Hear the sound of fallen angels
It's the call of the seventh star
The pyramids will fall
Turn to dust before the sun
And the star will rise again
Until destiny is done
Hear the sound of distant ages
It's the call of the seventh star
Hear the sound of fallen angels
It's the call of the seventh star

4,Danger Zone,"



Midnight, something don't feel right
It's been too much, too far away from home
Hard life, living the hard life
I can't resist, I'm falling
To the danger zone
All day long I'm pushed and shoved
I just can't get enough
In the danger zone
Red light, don't stop for no red light
You know I'm always trouble on my own
Lonely, ever so lonely
I've got too much time
I'm heading for the danger zone
All day long I'm pushed and shoved
I just can't get enough
In the danger zone
I'm eager, eager to please
I can't stand no more
It's got me on my knees
Ain't gonna feel no hurt
Ain't gonna feel no pain
I got nothin' left to lose
I ain't got no shame
Don't try to stop me
Just leave me on my own
I'm gonna live or die
In the danger zone
I'm living in the danger zone
In the danger zone
Hard life, I'm living the hard life
I'm gonna take a chance
In the danger zone
Lonely, ever so lonely
I'm gonna live or die
In the danger zone
Midnight, can't wait until midnight
Help me I'm falling to the danger zone


"
5,Heart Like A Wheel,"



In these days of confusion
You've turned angry and cold
You say it's an illusion
There's no fire in your soul
Say you don't love me
Say you don't care
But don't leave me standing here
Your heart's like a wheel
Just waiting to roll
It's longing for freedom
To get out on the road
You're hungry for something
That you may never find
So many reasons
Your love has made you blind
You say you don't love me
You say you don't care
So don't leave me standing here
Don't leave me standing here
You say you don't love me
You say you don't care
Don't leave me
Don't leave me standing here
Life ain't been easy
Full of passion and pain
Told me no reason
Why I was to blame
Don't leave me standing
Don't leave me standing
Don't leave me standing
On my own


"
6,Angry Heart,"



I still remember how it used to be
I thought the only thing
That mattered was me
You always told me it was just insane
To feel such joy
While others feel pain
There's no way to change this angry heart
Cause when love goes
It will tear you apart
And it's been this way since time began
It's a desperate search for a promised land
And the years slip by like so much sand
So many people who are dying to live
It tortures my heart
They've got so much to give
I never saw it as a battle before
To win the fight
There has to be more
And there's no way to change this angry heart
Cause all these fears
Will tear you apart
And it's been this way since time began
It's an endless journey, it's the fate of man
To live each day and never understand
And it's been this way since time began
It's a desperate search for a master plan
And the years slip by like water through your hands


"
7,In Memory...,"



No one told me the way I should feel
You left an aching heart
Lost and lonely, the feeling goes on
You were the one friend I had
You gave me so much love
Now the tears remind me you're gone
It still haunts me there's a silence
Where you used to be
It still haunts me
Just an empty space in history
It still haunts me
But life must go on, on and on
It's still haunting me
It's still haunting me
Haunting me
Haunting me
It's still haunting me
