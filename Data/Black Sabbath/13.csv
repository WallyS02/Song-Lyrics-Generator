0,End Of The Beginning,"



Is this the end of the beginning?
Or the beginning of the end?
Losing control or are you winning?
Is your life real or just pretend?

Reanimation of the sequence
Rewind the future to the past.
To find the source of the solution;
The system has to be recast.

Release your mind.
Fast forward to the secrets of your code.
Your life's on overload.
Delete or save

The units that make you an entity
That's your identity
If you don't know
Which way to go

You may be lost and confused
A second chance your turn to lose

Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul.
Transforming time and space beyond control;
Rise up  resist and be the master of your fate.
Don't look back live for today - tomorrow is too late.

You don't want to be a robot ghost
Occupied inside a human host
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly
Synthesized until they set you free.

Alright-okay alright till they set you free...
Alright-okay till they set you free, free, free, free
I don't want to see you yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't want to see you yeah, yeah, yeah


"
1,God Is Dead?,"



Lost in the darkness, I fade from the light
Faith of my father, my brother, my Maker and Savior
Help me make it through the night
Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb
Into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine

The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine, you keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?

Rivers of evil, run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal, and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?

When will this nightmare be over?
Tell me
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?

To safeguard my philosophy
Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a living death
I empathize with enemies
Until the timing's right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light

I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine
I don't need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I don't believe that God is dead
God is dead

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word what the Good Book said?
Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead?
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead, right?

But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that God is dead
The blood pours down, the rain turns red
I don't believe that God is dead
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead


"
2,Loner,"



He's just a loner
He never says hello
A friend to no one
He's got no place to go

He don't look happy
He look through furtive eyes
He ain't got nothing
No one to sympathize

Alright now

He hides himself away
His secrets not revealed
As life just passes by he keeps himself concealed

A solitary man
An enigmatic child
A riddle never solved
A prisoner exiled

Alright now

I wonder if the loner can assimilate
A life less lived alone plays devil's advocate

Come on yeah

Has he ever tried to be happy?
Reached out from inside
Someone on who he can depend
It's getting too late to recover
He won't stand a chance and into his own hell he'll descend

Don't descend [x4]

No understanding of things we already know
He has to live his life and just learn how to let go

Communication's an impossibility
His own best friend but he's his own worst enemy
The secrets of his past locked deep inside his head
I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead

Come on yeah


"
3,Zeitgeist,"



Astral engines in reverse
I'm falling through the universe again
Down among the deadmen's vision
Faded dreams and nuclear fission spent

The strings of theory are holding up the race
The puppets falling to the ground
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space
Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found
On this sinking ship I travel

Faster than the speed of light
Not so supernova burns
The black holes turn and fade from sight
The strings of theory hide in the human race
The answers buried underground
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space
Lost in time, I wonder will my ship be found

And very soon
The Bomber's moon
Will show us light
And as we crash
We'll pray and kiss
And say goodnight
Goodnight


"
4,Age Of Reason,"



Do you hear the thunder
Raging in the sky?
Premonition of
A shattered world that's gonna die.

In the Age of Reason,
how do we survive?
The protocols of evil
Ravaging so many lives?

Mystifying silence
Talking Peace on Earth.
We should judge each other
For ourselves not what we're worth.

Sustainable extinction,
A fractured human race.
A jaded revolution
Disappears without a trace.

Always felt that there'd be trouble.
Mass distraction hides the truth.
Prozac days and sleepless hours.
Seeds of change that don't bear fruit.

These time are heavy
And you're all alone.
The battle's over
But the war goes on.

Politics, religion,
Love of money too.
It's what the world was built for
But not for me and you.


"
5,Live Forever,"



Just before you die
They say you'll see your life go flashing by
Cold dark endless nights
To burn in hell or bathe in heaven's light

Well I don't wanna live forever
But I don't want to die...
I may be dreaming but whatever
I live inside a lie!

Days pass by too soon
Waiting for the rising of the moon
No escape from here
Facing death but is your conscience clear?

I may be dreaming or whatever
Watching my life go by
And I don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die!

Well, I don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die
I may be dreaming but whatever
I live inside a lie

Don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die
Don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die


"
6,Damaged Soul,"



Born in a graveyard adopted by sin,
I cultivate evil that's living within.
A preacher tried saving my black damaged soul,
Possessed by a demon that had full control.

The time it is coming when all life will end,
With doomsday approaching to hell we'll descend.
Religion won't save me, the damage is done.
The future has ended before it's begun.

Death's hand and the crazy, I can't stand the light of day.
Watching all the victims on their knees as they pray.
God of the almighty never answers their call.
Satan is just waiting for the righteous to fall to him.

I don't mind dying 'cause I'm already dead.
Pray not for the living I'll live in your head.
Dying is easy it's living that's hard.
I'm losing the battle between Satan and God.


"
7,Dear Father,"



A childhood innocence was drowned in your tears.
The demons that you fought are feeding your fears.
The poisoned secrets of your life stand revealed.
The truth destroys you, its no longer concealed.

Dear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing.
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin.
Yeah, in ruin, yeah.

You preyed upon my flesh then prayed for my soul.
Belief betrayed by lust, the faith that you stole.
Indoctrination by a twisted desire,
The catechism of an evil messiah.

Dear father forgive me, I know just what I'm doing.
In silence this violence will leave your life in ruin.
Yeah, in ruin, yeah.

Preacher of theocracy hiding your hypocrisy.
Under false sanctity, holy phoney empathy.
You have taken my life,
Now it's your turn to die.

Can you sleep at night? When you close your eyes
Do you think of all the pain from your lies?
Or do you deny you're responsible
For the victims of the sins you devised?

What you gonna tell them when they ask you? Well then
Is your conscience pure in your heart?
There is no exemption when you seek redemption
For all the lives that you've torn apart.

Your molestations of the cross you defiled,
A man once holy now despised and reviled.
You took possession while confessing my sins
And now you have to face whatever death brings, yeah.

Dear father forsaken, you knew what you were doing.
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin, yeah.
In ruin, yeah, yeah, yeah.
In ruin yeah.
