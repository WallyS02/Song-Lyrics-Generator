0,I Witness,"



Across the desert of the burning dark, a
Darkness which illuminates you,
There's a place you've always wanted to be,
Whose pleasures always did escape you,
It's always been so out of reach, nothing, so near
Ever felt so far,
And now it's here within your grasp, a never
Ending burning says it all.

[CHORUS:]
As you drive into the darkness, in front the future
Behind you history,
Caught alone in the dark night, do you think
That's the way it's supposed to be.
You don't believe your eyes, cos all they see is
Lies, oh yeah.

You better run from the holy man, the eyes that
Will are set up on you,
Listen not to verse and prayer, songs that thrill
And voices tempt you
The inner flame has fear of death, never, has
Light ever seemed so dark.
Pilgrims of sabbocracy, hear the hounds of
Heaven, as they bark.

[CHORUS:]
As you drive into the darkness, in front the future
Behind you history,
Caught alone in the dark night, do you think
That's the way it's supposed to be.
You don't believe your eyes, cos all they see is
Lies, oh yeah.

I witness a time and a place that never dies, still
Frozen in time,
This darkness the only place that I can hide, I
Witness, a dream.

[CHORUS:]
As you drive into the darkness, in front the future
Behind you history,
Caught alone in the dark night, do you think
That's the way it's supposed to be.
You don't believe your eyes, cos all they see is
Lies, oh yeah.

I witness a time and a place that never dies, still
Frozen in time,
This darkness the only place that I can hide, I
Witness, a dream.
Oh, just a dream.

1,Cross Of Thorns,"



Don't come closer, cos it ain't safe here,
Just turn around now and walk away.
I've gotta tell you, there are no rules here,
Sometimes I wonder, what goes on there,
Behind those eyes.

[CHORUS:]
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you,
Young ones crying with there heads in their hands,
When you talk about saving, the souls of the faithful,
You can't help thinking you've got blood on your
Hands.
From a cross of thorns.

Tongues of fire always talking, wasted words that
Ring in my ears.
We're still waiting, losing patience. Will all the lies
Of, 400 years.
I've got to tell you, there are no rules here,
Sometimes I wonder,
What goes on there, behind those eyes.

[CHORUS:]
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you,
Young ones crying with there heads in their hands,
When you talk about saving, the souls of the faithful,
You can't help thinking you've got blood on your
Hands.
From a cross of thorns.

We gave you yesterdays, and now you want to-day,
Oh, from the hands of death we take our daily bread,
Now all we do is choke, and the words that you once
Spoke, fade away.
Look at what you've done, oh, it's a cross of thorns.

Take away, this cross of thorns, look at what you've
Done,
It's a cross of thorns, cross of thorns.
When a promise is broken, and no one trusts you,
You've got blood on your hands, from a cross of
Thorns.

2,Psychophobia,"



Mortal eyes, looking through a veil of dreams,
Hypnotized, and ever living soul with wings.
Think you're god, but you never had control,
Think you're loved, but there's no one there at all...

[CHORUS:]
My colours all ran dry, and now I see the world in
Black and white,
It's too late now, it's time to kiss the rainbow
Goodbye.

Poison tears running from a palsied face,
Satan nears, descending on the human race.
Think you're god, but you never had control,
Think you're loved, but there's no one there at all...

[CHORUS:]
My colours all ran dry, and now I see the world in
Black and white,
It's too late now, it's time to kiss the rainbow
Goodbye.

Listen to the wind, hear the gospel blow,
Tell me that you don't hear what I'm hearing
And I will let you go.
Look up to the sky, put your trust in me,
Tell me that you ain't feelin' what I'm feelin' and I
Will set you free.

Look into the flame, see the embers glow,
Tell me that you don't see what I'm seein' and I
Will let you go.
Look up at the sky, put your trust in me,
Tell me that you ain't feelin' what I'm feelin' and I
Will set you free.

Look into the flame, see the embers glow,
Tell me that you don't see what I'm seein' and I
Will let you go.
Taste the holy blood, runnin from my veins,
Tell me that you ain't feelin' what I'm feelin' and
I'll take away the pain.
Yes I will now, oh yes I will. It's time to kiss the
Rainbow goodbye.


"
3,Virtual Death,"



Reach out and take for me, fruit of the poison
Tree,
Give me your body and your soul.
My youth is fading fast, years melt into the past,
This mortal life will take it's toll.

CHORUS:
I'm sick and tired of losing, you find this so
Amusing,
It's all I have to keep myself in this state I'm in.

This park of natures fire, my only one desire,
This world is hanging by a thread.

[CHORUS:]
I'm sick and tired of losing, you find this so
Amusing,
It's all I have to keep myself in this state I'm in.

People always tried to change me, alter everything
I am,
Though you find this so amusing, you left me in
This state I'm in.
Virtual death

You may think this existence, is just a human
Weakness,
Inside my mind it's near the end.
Virtual death

I'm losing, I'm fading fast. I'm dying, virtual death.


"
4,Immaculate Deception,"



In the daylight, comes darkness, on the verge of
Night a fear is born,
Sweeter than the dream, the reality of you,
Immaculate, deception.

From the spirit runs poison, and the wheel of
Fortune is ever still,
Sweeter than the light, the darkness of your soul,
Immaculate, deception.

Something has touched, the spirit inside,
Once there was love now there's a void.
Nights of deception, ghosts in my mind,
Am I bewitched, slave to desire.

It's knowing that times keeps rolling on, night after
Day, day after night,
It's knowing that feeling of coming home, to where
My spirit lies.

It's knowing that feeling of coming home, to where
My spirit lies.


"
5,Dying For Love,"



Can you hear, the people sing their song,
To tunes of glory, they move as one.
Refugees of liberation marching on,
Sing your song, rock the nation, write of wrongs.

When you take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's
Left is humanity.

It's getting closer, change is bound to come.
There's someone out there, holding candles to the
Sun.
Then an answer, says that peace will come around,
Stand in line, take your time and be proud.

Take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's left is
Humanity,
Take a man and steal tomorrow, all that's left is you
And me.

Hear them call you, soldiers all in the field of love,
Brothers, sisters, children all dying for love.

Refugees of liberation marching on,
Sing your song, rock the nation, write of wrongs.

Take a life and steal it's shadow, all that's left is
Humanity,
Take a man and steal tomorrow, all that's left is you
And me.

Hear them call you, soldiers all in the field of love,
Brothers, sisters, children all dying for love.

Hear them call you, dying for love, those who know
You, dying for love.
Brothers, sisters, dying for love, saints and sinners,
Dying for love,
Dying for love.

We are the star demons, reaching out yeah,
We want to touch your world,
We are the dream makers, pure and sweet yeah.
We're gonna change your world.

[CHORUS:]
When you're tired of giving reasons
And freedom fighting freedom

And freedom fighting freedom
If you're searching for an answer,
We can bring you back to Eden.


"
7,The Hand That Rocks The Cradle,"



Young life, too young, who's eyes are choking,
Can't rest, can't sleep, for dreams that set you
Falling.
Don't feel the hunger, can't drink no holy water,
No light in these eyes, no place for dreams at all
Tonight.

When the hand that rocks the cradle, is the hand
That holds the knife,
And the knife that cuts the cable, kills the spark that
Feeds the life.

[CHORUS:]
No grave could be deep enough, down to hell if we
Were able,
The veil of life was pushed aside, by the hand that
Rocks the cradle.

The oath you take is sacred, to save not steel a life,
Like the passing of the sweetest soul, that looked
Through human eyes.

[CHORUS:]
No grave could be deep enough, down to hell if we
Were able,
The veil of life was pushed aside, by the hand that
Rocks the cradle.

Young life, too young, who's eyes are choking,
Can't rest, can't sleep, for dreams that set you
Falling.
Don't feel the hunger, can't drink no holy water,
No light in these eyes, no place for dreams at all
Tonight.

[CHORUS:]
No grave could be deep enough, down to hell if we
Were able,
The veil of life was pushed aside, by the hand that
Rocks the cradle.

It's the hand that rocks the cradle, is the hand that
Steels the life.


"
8,Cardinal Sin,"



Where do you go when your conscience takes over
Do you crawl to your corner and cry,
Did you imagine, that no one would notice
Just a secret to take when you die.

All the world is watching you, every tongue is
Screaming sinner.

How are your dreams, do they claw at your sleep
Making darkness a place you despise,
Where is the god, that once was your strength
Are you sure he was there from the start.

All the world is watching you, nowhere you can hide,
Every tongue is screaming sinner, only satan hears your cries.

When you sin cardinal sin, you make your bed and on it you must lie,
And your futures looking grim, but did you ever give a damn
About the child, he's running wild,
When you sin cardinal sin, don't you expect the world will treat you well,
We say oh, go to hell.

We point the finger, sin cardinal sin, laugh in your face, sin
Cardinal sin,
We point the finger, laugh in your face,
Cos you're no better than the rest of the human race.

Oh sin cardinal sin, oh sin cardinal sin.


"
9,Evil Eye,"



Something about the way that you look on me,
You watch every move, every word, every fantasy,
Got no time for love, there's something on your mind,
Got the face of an angel but the stare of a devil inside.

[CHORUS:]
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,
People say the woman's got an evil eye.
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,
Free me from the woman with the evil eye.

I turn away but still I see that evil stare,
Trapped inside my dreams I know you're there.
Thoughts of happiness you destroyed them all,
First inside my head, then inside my soul.

[CHORUS:]
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,
People say the woman's got an evil eye.
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,
Free me from the woman with the evil eye.


"
10,What's The Use?,"



[Bonus track]

What's the use of paradise or everyday of livin'?
They spend and learn in Heaven, sin in Hell

What's the point of children
When evil got before them?
They learn in every tale we tell

There's no point in being kind
What's the use when love becomes an evil of the mind?

Oh Yeah!

What's the use of power
When the battle isn't equal
And we're all too Scared to use it anyway?

What's the point of reason
When no one wants to listen?
Deliverance is all too far away

Oh what's the use?
Oh what's the use?
Tell me, oh, what's the use?
What's the use?

Love becomes an evil of the mind
What's the use?

What's the use?...
