0,The Illusion Of Power,"



What is it that turns you on to the illusion of power,
This thing that grabs you by the heart and makes you want to tear things down.
There is no reason why I should need all this power, but if you cross me now,
I'm gonna tear your whole world down.

The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real,
The illusion of power.

I can' get the emotional thing straight in my head,
Everything I love dies to soon, or is already dead.
Don't stand too close I spit and breath fire,
Anything I've got now you cannot desire.

You want to be my friend I promise you nothing,
Nothing I can give you, nothing I can do for you,
I'm being chased by the sins of my past and it's killing me now,
Killing me now.

The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real,
The illusion of power.
The illusion of power, it's already set signed and sealed,
The illusion of power.

Powerful...who are you fooling?
You're caught in a complex cataclysm of your own inadequacies
And pitiful weaknesses
Your souls secretes insecurity
So you live on the reflection side of the mirror
You're terrified of true power...you fear me...

I can tell you stories of my
Shaded past and I can
Drag you down into the
Depths of my soul.

The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real,
The illusion of power.
The illusion of power, it's already set signed and sealed,
The illusion of power.

Why don't you come closer, Promise a story I will tell, yeah,
I'll save you from your dreams, yeah
I'll save you from your dreams.

1,Get A Grip,"



I see it on the TV, it's playing on my mind,
Everything I see has got something to do with killing my brother.

Just another mind game? or maybe it's a sign,
When the child with a gun holds it up to the head of his brother.

Well that ain't nice, gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life,
Gotta get a grip cause you're gonna slip, yeah.

Somebody tell me, where did we lose?
Where's the point that we lost the control to live with each other?
Mister politician, searching for a lie.
What's the truth? will the youth find the proof for a revolution?

Cause that ain't nice, gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life
Gotta get a grip cause you're gonna slip, on ice,
Gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life
Gotta get a grip cause you're gonna slip

Gotta get a hold of the situation, gotta get you into my life,
Gotta get a hold and get it moving.
I can't tell you what you need to know it's up to you, oh yeah

That ain't nice, gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life
Gotta get a grip, cause you're gonna slip, on ice,
Gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life
Gotta get a grip cause you're gonna slip.

Gotta get a hold of the situation, gotta get a hold on life,
Gotta get a grip and get it moving,
I can't tell you what you need to know, it's up to you, oh yeah.

Don't your blood run cold, don't the sorrow show,
Hold on tight to what you have.
See it in your eyes, don't it make you cry,
Get a grip and shake the can.
Get a grip, yeah, get a grip, yeah, get a grip, yeah,
Get a grip, get a grip, get a grip, get a grip, get a hold.
Get a grip on life, get a grip on life, get a grip on life,
Yeah get a grip.

2,Can't Get Close Enough To You,"



How many tears must we cry before learning,
Things that we have they're for real and we're losing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.

Why do you believe that we've got something coming,
You took it all, left me standing here with nothing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away,
Too fae away.

In your world you must be dreaming, if you think you can survive,
Taking all and giving nothing that's a crime.
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.

All I need is understanding and the right to survive,
Only you could see the warnings, and pass them by.
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
Too far away.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.

How many tears must we cry before learning,
Things that we had they're for real and we're losing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
Too far away, too far away, too far away.

3,Shaking Off The Chains,"



Is life everything you want to be,
Does it give you everything that you need,
Does it live up to your expectations,
Are you ready for the celebrations.

This is not for the weak of mind,
Are you sure that you're my kind,
Do you want to be part of me,
Are you sure that you can really see.

Are you chained to a life that you don't want,
Is it hard for you to find a way out,
Can you live without the love that you need,
Are you sure that what you have is so real.

This is not for the weak of mind,
Are you sure that you're my kind,
Do you want to be part of me,
Are you sure that you can really see.

All of your life, they try to take your cover,
Turn you into another, and make you change your name.
When you fall, it's up to you to recover,
You can't depend on another, to help you with the pain, yeah.

I'm shaking off the chains, I'm shaking off the chains.

This is not for the weak of mind,
Are you sure that you're my kind,
Do you want to be part of me,
Are you sure that you can really see.

In the night, you say that are falling
People always calling, calling out your name.
What do you know, a face appears at the window,
Tapping on the window, the window of your soul.

I'm shaking off the chains, I'm tired of all the pain,
I'm shaking off the chains, let me live again,
Shaking off the chains, shaking off the chains.

4,I Won't Cry For You,"



So you lie awake and think about tomorrow,
And you try to justify the things you've done,
But there's no one here, to hear your tears falling,
When you turn around, you find out, that you're the lonely one.

And it feels like someone's treading on your shadow,
And you always thought that Heaven knows for sure,
And it feels like you're drowning, in your tears.

So I won't cry for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you,
And I ain't gonna lie for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you.
Ain't gonna cry for you.

So you lie awake and think about the sorrow,
Does it really still the fears in your mind,
And you try to realise the things you wanted,
But you take it all for granted and now it makes you blind.

And it feels like someone's treading on your shadow,
And you always thought that Heaven knows for sure,
And it feels like you're drowning, in your tears.

So I ain't gonna cry for you, no I ain't gonna die for you,
And I ain't gonna lie for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you.
Ain't gonna cry

I ain't gonna cry for you, I ain't gonna cry.

So I ain't gonna cry for you, no I ain't gonna die for you,
No I ain't gonna lie for you, no I ain't gonna cry for you,
Ain't gonna cry, ain't gonna cry for you no more,
Ain't gonna die, I ain't gonna die for no more,
Ain't gonna lie, I ain't gonna lie for no more,
Ain't gonna cry, I ain't gonna cry for you no more.

5,Guilty As Hell,"



Step back and look at you, and tell me that is what you want to be,
You realise that what you're seeing, is a replica of me.
Inside my world is pretty grim, that even I can't survive in,
I wouldn't try 'cause I know you.

Deep inside you know you're guilty as Hell.
Deep inside you know you're guilty as Hell.

You realise that what you're seeing is just a replica of me,
Only me.

Oh it makes no difference if you're the only one,
It doesn't matter when all is said and done,
Gonna feel the same, God will put the blame on you.
Oh yeah.

If I was you, If I was you,
I'd wanna see, I'd wanna see inside my head,
I'd wanna know if I was fuckin dead,
I'd wanna know what's going on,
Someone tell me the truth.

There's no fear in a fallen Angel, there's no love in a heart made of stone,
There's no truth in a heart that is screaming,
Deep inside you're as guilty as Hell.
There's no fear in a fallen Angel, there's no love in a heart made of stone,
There's no truth in a heart that is screaming.
Deep inside you're as guilty as Hell.
You're guilty.

6,Sick And Tired,"



Got no time to be on the run,
Got no holes in my shoes,
You're the reasong all my friends have gone,
But I won't run from you.

So many promises, and you broke them all,
Oh I'll forgive, but I can't forget,
You know you're a fake, but I just can't take no more,
Cause I'm tired of it.

I'm so tired, so tired,
Sick and tired of it all,
I'm so tired, sick and tired,
I'm so tired, sick and tired of it all, yeah.

You turn the truth, then you turn your back,
You're a victim of yourself,
The hate remains, the hurting still exists.
I'm so tired of it all.

I'm so tired, sick and tired,
So damn tired, sick and tired of it all, oh yeah,
I'm so tired, I'M sick and tired of it all.


"
7,Rusty Angels,"



They say you came from heaven but I know that's not the truth,
Cause I don't think an Angel could look anything like you,
Your eyes are made from sapphires and your heart is made from stone,
You gotta be the closest thing to hate I've ever known,
And if I didn't know better I'd say you had come alone to the party.
Oh yeah.

The light is always shining, but you swear that it's gone black,
The tide is always turning, but you're never looking back,
If I didn't know better I'd say times were pretty bad,
Because Rusty Angels they can't fly,
Rusty Angels gonna die, yeah,
Rusty Angels they can't fly,
Rusty Angels gonna die, gonna die.

The gifts you bring are fire, and your dreams they turned to dust,
Your flying days are over, and your wings have turned to rust.
If I didn't know better, I'd say all you had is lost,
Because Rusty Angels they can't fly,
Rusty Angels gonna die, yeah,
Rusty Angels they can't fly,
Rusty Angels gonna die, gonna die.

If you swallow just a little pride, you might find a little love inside,
Open up and let somebody in, 'cause if you need somebody,
You know it's not a sin.

Rusty Angels they can't fly, Rusty Angels gonna die, yeah,
Rusty Angels they can't fly, no, Rusty Angels gonna die,
Gonna die, yeah, you can't fly, oh no,
Gonna die, oh yeah, you can't fly, oh no.

8,Forbidden,"



If I had to live again, I'd change everything,
'Cause everything I do, you know that I can't win.
You say it isn't right, but you say it isn't wrong,
How the Hell am I supposed to please everyone.

Tell me what it is that I'm supposed to do.
I aint here for everybody, but I aint here for you,
You said it isn't right, but you said it isn't wrong.
I wish somebody could tell me, what it is that I've done wrong.

The best things in live aren't given, these things aint for you and me,
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.
The best things in live aren't given, these things aint for you and me,
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.

You know it's gonna get you now, and you know it starts to bring you down.

Tell me what it is that I'm supposed to do,
I aint here for everybody, but I aint here for you,
It seems I have to fight, for all the things I want,
Wish somebody could tell me what it is that I've done wrong.

The best things in live aren't given, these things aint for you and me,
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.
The best things in live aren't given, these things aint for you and me,
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.

It's Forbidden.

The best things in live aren't given, these things aint for you and me,
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.
The best things in live aren't given, these things aint for you and me,
Every time you shout Forbidden, makes me wonder what you see.
Makes me wonder what you see.

9,Kiss Of Death,"



This is no ordinary soul, that you're destroying,
Not just another life that drifts along with the sands of time.
We tried to show you on your way, but still, you cannot see, you're hurting me
You told too many lies and so it ends, yeah

You tried to touch me, but then I knew your plan,
You tried to take my world away, oh no,
Now I see it, it's as clear as day,
No you'll never stand a chance, oh no you'll never stand a chance.

You tried to lead me, to the land where you keep your lies,
But I've seen this read before, oh yeah,
There is no reason why I should listen now,
No you'll never stand a chance, oh no you'll never stand a chance.

So many people tried before, but still I came through stronger than before,
Someone like you will never get through my door no more,
Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible.
Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible. Yeah.

Every lie that you tell you get closer,
Closer to the edge of the Cauldron and in to the fire, yeah.
Every life you destroy will return, it will come back and haunt you,
For ever and ever.

Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible.
Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible. Yeah.

This is no ordinary soul that you're destroying,
Not just another life that drifts along with the sands of time.

10,Loser Gets It All,"



[Japan Bonus Track]

It's a loaded dice, that you throw this time,
If you turn the Ace, it'll turn out fine,
When you spin the wheel, and you get your call,
South of the line, well the loser gets it all.

One too many days, one too many nights,
You cried too many tears, had too many fights,
And you know it's a bad time, Bad time to lose.

Every face you see, has the staring eyes
Every passing glance, makes you realize
And you know it's a bad time, Bad time to lose.

God knows there's no good time.

Too many days, and too many nights,
You cried too many tears, had too many fights,
And you know it's a bad time, Bad time to lose,
Yeah, yeah, Bad time to lose,
Bad time to lose, Bad time to lose.
