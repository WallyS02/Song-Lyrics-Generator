0,Trashed,"



It really was a meeting
The bottle took a beating
The ladies of the manor
Watched me climb into my car and
I was going down the track about a hundred and five
They had the stop-watch rolling
I had the headlights blazing I was really alive
And yet my mind was blowing
I drank a bottle of tequila and I feel real good
I had the tape deck roaring
But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn
I went of exploring
I knew I wouldn't make it the car just wouldn't make it
I was turning tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye

I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way
I had the wheels in motion
There was Peter and the Green fly laughing like drains
Inebriation
The crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch
In my imagination
But at the canal turn I hit an oily patch
Inebriation

Ooh Mr. Miracle you saved me from some pain
I thank you Mr. Miracle I won't get trashed again
Ooh can you hear my lies
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes

So we went back to the bar and hit the bottle again
But there was no tequila
Then we started on the whisky just to steady our brains
'Cos there was no tequila
And as we drank a little faster at the top of our hill
We began to roll
And as we get trashed we were laughing still
Well bless my soul

1,Disturbing The Priest,"



Let's try getting to the sky
Hang on or you're going to die
Sour life can turn sweet
It's laying at your feet
Sweet child with an innocent smile
Watched closely all the while
Don't be fooled when he cries
Keep looking at the eyes

Good life is contradiction
Because of the crucifixion
If you're ready and have the need
I will take your soul and plant my seed

You just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day
You just gotta listen to the night as safety slips away
Moving out of sight are the things you need to see to feel
And as they slip away becoming so unreal unreal
You just gotta listen to the night as you're going up stairs
You just gotta listen to the night and don't forget to say your prayers
And as you lose control to the eyes in dark disguise
And icy fingers fan electric lies

We're disturbing the priest
Won't you please come to our feast
Do we mind disturbing the priest
Not at all not at all not in the least

The force of the devil is the darkness the priest has to face
The force of the night will destroy him but will not disgrace
To get into his mind and to his soul you gotta set a light
The flames of doubt so deep inside inside
The devil and the priest can't exist if one goes away
It's just like the battle of the sun and the moon and the night and day
The force of the devil that we're all told to fear
Watched out for religion when he gets too near too near

2,Zero The Hero,"



Accept the fact that you're second rate life is easy for you
It's all served up on a gold plated plate
And we don't even have to talk to you
Your face is normal that's the way you're bred
And that's the way you're going to stay
Your head is firmly nailed to your TV channel
But someone else's finger's on the control panel

What you gonna be brother - Zero the hero
Don't you wanna be brother - Zero the hero
When you gonna be brother - Zero the hero
Impossibility impissibolity mother really a hero

You sit there watch it all burn down
It's easy and breezy for you
You play your life to a different sound
No edge no edge you got no knife have you
Your life is a six lane highway to nowhere
You're going so fast you're never ever gonna get down there
Where the heroes sit by the river
With a magic in their music as they eat raw liver

You stand there captain we all look
You really are mediocre
You are the champion in the Acme form book
But I think you're just a joker
Your freedom life ain't so much of a pity
But the luv-a-duckin' way you're walkin' around
The city with your balls and your head full of nothing
It's easy for you sucker but you really need stuffing

3,Digital Bitch,"



She wears her leather just to satisfy
She really throws it around
There ain't one thing she can't afford to buy
She's the richest bitch in town

Her big fat daddy was a money machine
He made a fortune from computers
She's got more money than I've ever seen
But she's a greedy emotional looter

Keep away from the digital bitch
She's so rich the digital bitch

She's got five rollers and a fine estate
A big house upon hill
She throws parties just to celebrate
Her life is just one ginormous thrill

She buys poor people just to have around
She has a trophy for each lover
The bitch is rich but baby pound for pound
She's got a lot more to discover

Maybe she could please me if I saw beneath her veil
But she's just imitation woman up for sale

She got so famous that she's on TV
She's got a professional smile
But I switch over 'cos she ain't for me
She disturbs me all the while

She looks so happy but she's got it wrong
She's always going faster
She sings her life to such a different song
She needs a loving and dominant master

4,Born Again,"



As you look through my window
Deep into my room
At the tapestries all faded
Their vague and distant glories
Concealed in the gloom
The icy fingers of forgotten passions
Softly brushing my lips
At the tips of my primitive soul

As you look through my door
Deep into my room
Can you feel the mighty wall of power
It's waiting waiting in the glow
The distant shadows of forgotten champions
Those who live in me still
And will rise when we challenge and kill

Born again
You'll be born again

Look at this prince of evil
Fighting for your mind
Fighting all priests of shame
For the thrust of my challenge is aimed
At the hearts of mutant gods
Who think we're all the same
They're controlling our minds
And they use us for fortune and fame

As you look through my window
Deep into my room
At your future and freedom
The grey and plastic retards all floating in circles
And as you taste the fruits of new sensations
Softly brushing your lips
As we rise when we challenge and kill

Born again
You'll be born again

If you want to be a king for a day
Just do what I say

Everybody's got to think like a hunter
Just search for your pray

Be alive through the night and the day
Just do it my way


"
5,Hot Line,"



Take me to the river baby drink my wine
When I'm going down won't you throw me a line
Lead me to religion take me up them stairs
When I take a tumble will you say me some prayers

When will you show me a sign
When will you throw me a line

Help me to the answer baby set me free
I'm torn between the devil and the deep blue sea
Maybe if you wanted you could save my face
Keep me out of trouble and I'm living disgrace

Show me to a sucker and you'll see my name
Standing in a line with the shadows of fame
Lead me to a legend take me up them stairs
When I take a tumble will you say me some prayers


"
6,Keep It Warm,"



Sweet woman are you feeling right
What was it that you did last night
You made me crazy you made me fly
I can't forget the hungry look in your eye
Ooh what's the matter with me?
I'm just a runner I was born free
But since I met you I can't leave you alone
I'm leaving now but I'll be coming home

Keep it warm rat the place by your side
Nobody's gonna take away our magical ride
Keep it warm for when we talk on the phone
Don't forget will you pretty one that your man is coming home

D'you hear the rumour that is going around
Say I'm ruined 'cos I've settled down
It's not true well maybe half and half
You know I love you but I still like a laugh
Ooh I'm feeling fine I got it right for the first time
Sweet woman I can't stay for long but everybody will be prove wrong

I'm like a gypsy I need to roam
But don't worry I'll be coming home
I need the danger I need the thrill
I need to know what is over each hill
Ooh I'm a different man I'm still running but you understand
Since I met you I can't leave you alone
I'm leaving now but I'll be coming home
