0,Headless Cross,"



Look through the people, and on through the mist
To the hill of the headless cross
Where all witches meet, on a night such as this,
And the power of darkness is host
They come face to face, eye to eye, soul to soul,
With an Angel that fell from the sky
Borne on the air, are the screams and the wails
Of the masses appointed to die

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture,
At the headless cross, at the headless cross

From the first evil night, when a black flash of light
Cut the crucifix half to the ground
There's been no escape from the power of Satan,
On a nation so brave and so proud

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture,
At the headless cross, at the headless cross

How do you feel, when the locks refuse the key
And the master is calling your name,
Does the luck of the charm, really keep you from harm
Does the talisman protect you from pain

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture,
At the headless cross, at the headless cross

From the first evil night, when a black flash of light
Cut the crucifix half to the ground
There's no escaping from the power of Satan
For a people so brave and so proud

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture,
At the headless cross, at the headless cross
At the headless cross, at the headless cross

Where will you run to, at the headless cross
Look, to the headless cross

1,Devil And Daughter,"



Silence is mocking, the dawn of a new day
Devil and Daughter, are both on their way
The Evil of her nature, collects in her eyes
With him there's no fear, of the dawn bringing light

Baptised with fire, to wild to be tamed
She's hot, evil and ready, to take any man
Let no one put asunder, the power or the pain
He is the master of hell, riding again

Devil and Daughter - pleasure and pain
Devil and Daughter - is this the end

A thousand times over, you'll hear on the wind
In the name of hell, these sinners never sinned
But Satan never listens, to the words that they send
Drenching the soil with blood, when will it end

Devil and Daughter
He's got the power she's got the pain
Devil and Daughter
She'll break any woman and take any man
Devil and Daughter
Hand in hand with the reper

2,When Death Calls,"



He saw the world, dim with the glow of the vertical sun
His skin crept cold knowing that this was the hours of dying
Misguided mortals you'll burn with me,
Spirit of man, cannot be freed

When death calls - this is the hours of dying
When death calls - the spirit of man can be freed
When death calls - there's no tomorrow
When death calls - just an evil shadow

Tell me not fear of the flames means that heaven is closer
For I believe, Satan lives, in the souls of dying
Misguided mortals you'll burn with me,
Spirit of man, cannot be freed

When death calls - heaven is closer
When death calls - feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying
When death calls - here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
When death calls - you're gonna burn

Don't look in those sunken eyes
Don't look and you'll stay alive
Don't laugh in the face of death or your tongue will blister
Can't die until Satan says, you die
And Satan takes your soul
In the face of death or your tongue will blister

Don't look in those sunken eyes
Don't look and you'll stay alive
Don't laugh in the face of death or your tongue will blister
Can't die until Satan says, you die
The Devil takes your soul
With all his wrath he calls the reper

When death calls - this is the hours of dying
When death calls - the spirit of man can be freed
When death calls - there's no tomorrow
When death calls - just an evil shadow

When death calls - feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying
When death calls - your gonna burn, burn, burn
When death calls - heaven is closer
When death calls - I can feel it, gonna take you down

3,Kill In The Spirit World,"



There's something wrong there's a chill in the air
And the blood in my vein's running colder
The eastern sky is beginning to silver
And the words that you speak start to falter
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed
In the house of the dead there's a taker
Some say that this is the ultimate sin
When the spirit world turns to the alter

There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world

Behold, the dead clutching at fading hands, out of reach forever
""In glory die"" calls the voice of the void
Your assassin has cursed every spectre
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed
And the house of the dead seeks a master
Stretching every muscle, wait for the end
And a kiss on the wind, whispers murder, murder

There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world

When heaven is closer, it's pleasure and pain
Kill in the spirit world

Did you see another in black
Is the blood in your veins running colder
If you did then there's no turning back
As the spirit world turns to the alter

The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed
And the house of the dead seeks a master
Stretching every muscle, wait for the end
And a kiss on the wind, whispers murder

There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world

Oh here it comes, oh no

The seal is broken, the eastern sky is beginning to silver
There's something wrong, there's a chill in the air
I feel the Evil, I feel the Evil
Somebody whispers murder

A kiss on the wind whispers murder


"
4,Call Of The Wild,"



In this last and final hour, you can't hide
There's nowhere now that you can run
All eyes are on you, like a lost eternal light
Princes and kings, and demons with wings
Summon your fears from hell

It's the call of the wild
Calling you

In this last macabre hour, witches cry
And turn to dust before the moon
Many spirits are lost forever, but one survives
To call the tune of Lucifer

It's the call of the wild
Calling you

Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams
Hero, don't believe in fate it ain't what it seems
All you gotta do now is stay free
You're the one they turn to when hell screams

Fear of the devil, has no place among the brave
Faced with pain, there's a battle to be won
All eyes are on you, like a host eternal light
Princes and kings, and demons with wings
Summon your fears from hell

It's the call of the wild
Calling you

Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams
Hero, don't believe in fate it ain't what it seems
Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams
Hero, don't believe in fate it ain't what it seems

Hero, you got the fear of the devil, burning your soul
Hero, it's the call of the wild
Hero, tearing your soul

5,Black Moon,"



Oh the devil is rising with the moon, he cries and my blood runs cold
Oh no never was the darkness so black, no light and nowhere to go
My spirit is crying for a love so tired of being alone
I remember he came here to steal, and you are his stealer of souls

I see a black moon rising
And it's calling out my name
Oh it's calling my name

I've been blinded, lost and confused, darkness will call me no more
Heaven is no friend of mine, no god ever knocked on my door

I see a black moon rising
And it's calling out my name
It's calling out my name
Oh it's calling

I see a black moon rising
And it's calling out my name
Oh it's calling my name

I'm standing on the dark side of time reaching for the power of her hand
She's weaving an unholy light and calls from Lucifer's land

I see a black moon rising
And it's calling out my name
An angel of hell is rising
Heaven's no friend of mine
I see a black moon rising
And it's calling out my name

I see a black moon rising
And it causes so much pain
An angel of hell is rising
Heaven's no friend of mine
I see a black moon rising
And it's calling out my name
Oh it's calling my name

This spirits crying for love
Heaven's no friend of mine
An angel of hell is rising
I see a black moon rising


"
6,Nightwing,"



Nightwing has stirred, and taken to flight
The silence is over, he's shattered the night
No other hunter has the power or the grace
He is the master of this place

Tell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
So listen my friend
Nightwing flies again

They say he comes, for those whose souls are weak,
And calls his name upon the wind
The night is cold and thick with mystery
Oh I can feel his beating wings

Tell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
Nightwing flies again

Tell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
Nightwing flies again

Nightwing has stirred, and taken to flight
The silence is over, he's shattered the night
Life ain't for giving and forgivin' ain't free
No soul will rest while the hunted run free

So tell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
Listen my friend
Nightwing flies again


"
7,Cloak And Dagger,"



I remember the burning I felt inside
As you touched my frozen heart
I remember the screams and the pain within
As my soul was torn apart
I recall being hungry
And for years I stood my ground
Even though you were never, oh no never, never around
God, how I needed you
I remember they warned me, and oh how they told me
Yours was the kiss of shame
I remember the Devil coming to steal my soul again and again
I remember the dawn was breaking
In Cathedrals of unholy light
I was searching for answers where singers and dancers
Will travel on through the night
I've been hurt by Evil games
First you're here and then you aint
Cloak and dagger, yeah, yeah yeah
Cloak and dagger
Cloak and dagger, yeah, yeah yeah
Cloak and dagger
Oh there's something about you that doesn't seam real
You say if I don't sell my soul you will steal
A promise should stand I know the command
And me like a fool took it in
In the valley of Death do I stand in the shadow
Or fight for the right to be free?
A kiss on the wind whispers die, die for glory
No, no
Cloak and dagger - You've been playing those Evil games
Cloak and dagger - Set me free I don't need this pain
Cloak and dagger - Something about you just doesn't seem real
Cloak and dagger - Your say if I don't sell my soul you will steal
Cloak and dagger - Your kiss of shame has been hunting me
Cloak and dagger - God, how I needed you
