0,Computer God,"



Waiting for the revolution
New clear vision - genocide
Computerize god - it's the new religion
Program the brain - not the heartbeat

Onward all you crystal soldiers
Touch tomorrow - energize
Digital dreams
And you're the next correction
Man's a mistake so we'll fix it, yeah

Take a look at your own reflection
Right before your eyes
It turns to steel

[Chorus:]
There's another side of heaven
This way - to technical paradise
Find it on the other side
When the walls fall down

Love is automatic pleasure
Virtual reality
Terminal hate - it's a calculation
Send in the child for connection

Take a look at the toys around you
Right before your eyes
The toys are real

[Chorus]

Midnight confessions
Never heal the soul
What you believe is fantasy

Your past is your future
Left behind
Lost in time
Will you surrender

Waiting for the revolution
Program the brain
Not the heartbeat

Deliver us to evil
Deny us of our faith
Robotic hearts bleed poison
On the world we populate

Virtual existence
With a superhuman mind
The ultimate creation
Destroyer of mankind

Termination of our youth
For we do not compute
No !


"
1,After All (The Dead),"



What do you say to the dead
Will you forgive me for living
Can't believe the things that they said
Wonderful day for a killing
It's killing me

What do they do with your soul
Is it just lying there busted
When did you lose all control
Is there someone to be trusted
With my mind

Oh there's insufficient evidence
Of what just might come after
But sometimes out of nowhere
There's demented sounds of laughter

Are we all haunted by
The ghost - imagination
It just can't be
I've seen them there
Howling at the moon

Is it just me
Or does somebody else believe this
Well I'm not alone
And I'm not afraid
There's just one way to see

After all [etc.]

What do you say to the dead
Is there a place where it's burning
It says in a book I once read
Yes there's a chance of returning
Turn to me

The fundamental principles
Say nothing of forever
But those are voices that I hear
Or I'm just not so clever

It can't be me
I know somebody else believes this
Well I'm not alone
I'm not afraid
Just one way to see

After all [etc.]

2,TV Crimes,"



One day in the life of the lonely
Another day on the round about
What do they need
Somebody to love

One night in the life of the lonely
There's a miracle on the screen
What did they see
Somebody to love

He guarantees you instant glory
Get your money on the line

Gotta send me a plastic Jesus
There's a check in the mail today
That's what I need
Somebody to love

We just won't eat on Sunday
Gotta buy him a limousine
Somewhere to live
Somewhere to pray

Every penny from the people
Keeps the wolf outside the door
Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself
But he'll give you more, yeah

Holy father, holy ghost
Who's the one who pays the most
Rock the cradle don't you cry
Buy another lullaby

Jack is nimble, Jack is quick
Pick your pocket, turn a trick
Slow and steady, he's got time
To commit another TV crime
TV crime

One day in the life of the lonely
Back again on the round about
What do they need
Somebody to love

Yeah

One night in the life of the lonely
Another miracle on the screen
What did they see
Somebody to love again

A supermarket of salvation
Take a look inside the store
Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself
But he gives more

Holy father, holy ghost
Who's the one who hurts you most
Rock the cradle when you cry
Scream another lullaby

Jack be nimble, Jack be slick
Take the money, get out quick
Slow and steady, so much time
To commit another
TV Crime, TV Crime

3,Letters From Earth,"



Well it's a cold world
And I'm in the middle
Caught in the in-between

I don't belong here
So I'm writing to you
It's wrong here
Where I'm sending you some

[Chorus:]
Letters from earth, yeah

Well it's a new world
And now I'm a stranger
Stranger than you know

I don't belong here
And I'm writing to you
With blood on my hands

What if I send you madness
What if I send you pain
And letters from earth, ooh
All right

Come on it's another game
But you gotta play on
Cause they say it's just pretend
Ask them why they say you'll never, never die
Come on - the game is called the end

Well it's a cold world
And I'm in the middle
Caught in the in-between

I don't belong here
So I'm writing to you
Hey let me explain

What if I send you confusion
What is the time and the pain worth
Oh no no
I'm only sending -
Letters from the earth

Letters from earth, ...


"
4,Master Of Insanity,"



Look all around
Can't you open your eyes
Voices are calling

Killing rain falling down from the sky
Crying with nightmare tears

Out on the street
You'll see blood on the ground
Cities are burning

Feeling the pain cutting right to your soul
Goodbye now
You're caught in his spell

Your freedom is gone
He's taken everything
You ever had
But if you're strong you'll survive
You've got to hold on
Open your eyes

[Chorus:]
Behind the lies you will see
The master of insanity
Under the mask there will be
The master of insanity

Innocent minds
They're the victims of shame
Staring in sorrow

Promises lying there
Broken and crushed
Confusion-just disappear

What can you give
To be left all alone
When there's nothing at all

Your freedom is gone
He's taken everything
You ever had
But if you're strong you'll survive
You've got to hold on
Open your eyes

[Chorus]

Behind the lies you will find
He's trying to get inside you
Just open your eyes and you will see
The master of insanity

[Chorus]

Between the lies you will find
that he's trying to get inside you
Out of the night into your mind
He's always right beside you

Yeah, between the lies you will see
The master of insanity
Open your eyes or you will be
The master of insanity


"
5,Time Machine,"



Oh what are you gonna do
When there's a part of you
That needs to run with the wind

And the fire of burning yesterdays
Can only light the way
To lead you from
The garden of the dark
Stay out of shadows

Now look like the change is on
Tomorrow's never gone
Today just never comes

Go on and jump,yeah
Into the hurricane
You will forger the pain
It's only there
To exorcise your mind

Looking at the world
When you've open up your eyes
You've got to see the promises they've made
They're bloody lies and broken dreams
Your silence screams

[Chorus:]
You're living in a time machine
And you can choose just who you are
Someone that you've never seen
Somewhere you've never been
You're living in a time machine

Oh what are you gonna do
When every part of you
Just needs to catch the wind

And the fire of burning yesterdays
Can only light the way
To lead you from
The garden of the dark

Looking for the world
When you've opened up your eyes
You'll see you've got invisible chains
They're only lies
Not what it seems
I hear your silent screams

[Chorus:]
You're living in a time machine
Nobody cares just where you go
Taken where you've never been
?? somewhere you don't know

You're living in a time machine
Why do you stay who you are
Be what you've never been
Someone you've never seen
You're living in a time machine
Yeah


"
6,Sins Of The Father,"



I am the crazy man
Who lives inside your head
But I think I'm breaking through the wall

You are the innocent
Convicted of the crime
No one was ever there
To catch you when you fall

I see the diamonds
But you only see the rock
I need to run
But you only crawl

It's time to open up
All the doors that you keep locked
Nobody gives without a take
Let's take it all

[Chorus:]
You've been twisted into pieces
By the hands of your emotions
How much longer are you gonna pay
For yesterday
Sins of the father

One more crucifixion
One more cross to bear
You're a hole in a photograph

Go on - lose it in the city
The city can feel no shame
See the world with electric eye

They call it mystery
But any fool could see
You thought he walked on the water

And if the pain was gone
And you were free to run away
And get out

Would you get out of there
Or do you really care
It's not safe or easy
And maybe when you're gone
You just won't belong at all

[Chorus:]
You're the only witness
To the murder of an angel
How much longer are you gonna pay
For yesterday
Sins of the father

It's just another crucifixion
One more cross to bear
Go on lose it in the city
Take a look at the world
You've got electric eyes


"
7,Too Late,"



Soon it's never more
When you've got to pay for
Promises - made in the night

Call the magic one
And with the magic comes
Forever chained to the flame

[Chorus:]
It's too late
Too late for tears
Too late
And no one hears you
Do you feel a touch of evil
(then) It's too late

To wish and make it so
To feel the power growing
Stronger - blessed by the dark

And when the candle fades
You can say it was a
Joke you played
So you must let me go - no

[Chorus:]
It's too late
You've said the word
Too late
Something heard you
Too late - now the race is on
And you're run out of road
Too late
For tears
Too late
And no one hears you
Can you feel the touch of evil
It's too late

Oh oh oh save me
I believe in your name
Oh oh I've fallen down
But now I've found
Nobody to take the blame

Misery
It's come to drag me away
And when the hunter cries
No alibis
Get ready for judgement day

As the candle fades
You can say it was a game you made
So you must let me go, let me go

It's too late - you've said the word
Too late - something heard you
Too late - the spell is gone
And this time you're the fool

It's too late for tears
Too late
And no one hears you
Welcome to forever
Welcome it's too late
Too late


"
8,I,"



I am anger
Under pressure
Locked in cages
A prisoner
The first to escape

I am wicked
I am legion
Strength in numbers
A lie
The number is one

I - I - I
Everything that I see is for me

Yes, I am giant
I'm a monster
Breaking windows
In houses
Buildings of glass
Rebel rebel
Holy outlaw
Ride together
Don't try it
The power's in one

I - I - I
I am standing alone
But I can rock you
I - I - I

On the edge of the blade
But the knife can't cut the hero down

I am virgin
I'm a whore
Giving nothing
The taker
The maker of war
I'll smash your face in
But with a smile
All together
You'll never
Be stronger than me

I - I - I
Right here on my own
But I still rock you
I - I - I
Don't follow behind
Just leave me on the outside

I - I - I
I am standing alone
But I can shock you
I - I - I
On the edge of the blade
But no one makes the hero bleed
( No, no , no )

I am hunger
Feed my head
All together
You'll never
Never make the hero bleed
( No, no, no )


"
9,Buried Alive,"



Once upon a nightmare
Once upon a time
You're running from temptation
You got lost
And found that you don't

Belong to anybody
You're all the same
Just another number
Cross it out
Whenever you don't behave

Someone got the doctor
He knows what to do
Throw some bones and mumble
The devil's inside of you

It might be contagious
It might change the plan
Get back in your tiny boxes
Even if you can't
We say you can

Join the congregation
Everybody's got to get in line and
We never justify
The choir sings a never-ending lie

[Pre-chorus:]
When you thought you were free
You didn't need a reason
No reason to survive

[Chorus:]
As the big door closes
And you waiting for the nail
Somebody tell the world
You're buried alive

Once upon a nightmare
Once upon a time
You're running from tomorrow
You got lost
And found that another
Day has turned to ashes
Taken by the wind
Frozen seeds of sorrow
Never to begin

Join the celebration
And everybody's got to get in line and
We never justify
The choir sings a never-ending lie

[Pre-chorus:]
When you thought you were free
You did not need a reason
No reason to survive

[Chorus:]
As the big door closes
And you waiting for the mail
Somebody tell the world
You're buried alive

One more nightmare
Just one more time
Join the congregation
Everybody get in line

Celebration
The choir sings a lie
As you call
The hammer falls
And no one hears you cry
I'm buried alive
