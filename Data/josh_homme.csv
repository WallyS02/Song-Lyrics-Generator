0,0,(Beginning Of What's About To Happen) ,"In the middle of the Highway, 
As you ride down the road,

Well open up the land.

From the mother of earth to the depth of the sea. 
Well dont raise any hand for me, 
When ya na na na na need me.

1,1,100' ,"Step on it,
I beg you please,
Jus' 100' I'm on my knees,
It's the one you blow,
It's the one you show,
So then you know I'm right


There's been a place built for you,
Sit by the fire tell, me truths,
Don't blind my eyes turn them blue,
And then I'll dry my face on you

Step on,
I beg you please,
Jus' 100' so I freeze,
Drowning in that ice I fly,
It's a great white place,
And the heat's diseased

23,23,Into the Void ,"Rocket engines burning fuel so fast 
Up into the night sky they blast 
Through the universe the engines whine 
Could it be the end of man and time 
Back on earth the flame of life burns low 
Everywhere is misery and woe 
Pollution kills the air, land, and sea 
Man prepares to meet his destiny 

Rocket engines burning fuel so fast 
Up into the black sky so vast 
Burning metal through the atmosphere 
Earth remains in worry, hate and fear 
With the hateful battles raging on 
Rockets flying to the glowing sun 
Through the empires of eternal void 
Freedom from the final suicide 

Freedom fighters sent out to the sun 
Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution 
Leave the earth to all its sin and hate 
Find another world where freedom waits 

Past the stars in fields of ancient void 
Through the shields of darkness where they find 
Love upon a land a world unknown 
Where the sons of freedom make their home 
Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves 
Leave them to their future in their grave 
Make a home where love is there to stay 
Peace and happiness in every day "

Well it burns, then wraps your soul

Shut it, shut it on

Comes back around, you know 
Holding on too long is just
Fear of letting go 
Because not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know 
One thing that is clear
It's all downhill from here 

The love line in your hand cleverly disguised 
All the promises of stone crumble in the light

Run, you'll never escape 
You'll see you go nowhere 
Based on who you appear

Broke, laid to waste
Turn into sweet nothings
Kiss you goodbye

The truth hurts so bad 
Wouldn't you say? 
So why tell it? 
If ignorance is bliss 
Then I'm in heaven now

Keep going over and over again 
To never ending places I've never been 
No one's catching on, calling my bluff 
The Devil made me holier than every man

Making us all forget,

Now the time has come 
To leave this love that's left you dry 
No need to work this out now 
Cause you know there's no reason why

You can't hold this boy for long, dig it 
By the time you read my letter 
Baby, I'll be gone 

You're just another love song

To twist the tale
Into fire wood
Fan the flames
With a little lie
Then turn your cheek
Until the fire dies
The skin it peels

Or am I walking alone?
When I turned around and found that you'd gone before 
The first rain could fall

It seems every single time I was bleeding
Broken promises that never came true 
Well it ain't so long before the dawn 
When the sun has gone so are
Well, so are you

So what's it gonna take
To get you back in bed?
Gossips, drugs, and snakes
They're just our best fairweather friends (fairweather friends)

One day when we're far away
From everything that hurts 
Drink and screw is all we'll do

71,23,Feet don't fail me ,"I was born in the desert, May 17 in '73
When the needle hit the groove
I commence to moving
I was chasing what's calling me

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
One foot in the gutter
One in the clouds
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on

Life is hard, that's why no one survives
I'm much older than I thought I'd be
Feel like a fool, just like a dancing fool, yeah
Footloose and fancy free

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
Stand in the gutter with my head in the clouds
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on

Push myself, the breaking point
It's all I know to do except for why?
I chase break lights and bust ad nauseam
Driven by feelings I cannot hide
To be so civilized, one must tell civil lies
On and on and on and on and...


Me and my gang come to bust you loose
We move with an urgency
Between pleasure and agony, on a runaway line
That's the sound that's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's

Time to go, regret it later
We're gon' take it as it comes
Future tense meets middle finger
We take the long way home

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
Do whatcha gotta do
Oh do it now
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on"

Up your sleeve

I want some (come on, take it)
of all of you (it's yours)
Trickin me

First it giveth
Then it taketh away

I would beg
I would plead
I would shake

On a hook
Dangling
By the way

I'm so young
And beautiful

I'm no fool

Time goes by
Tables turn
Now I know

First it giveth

73,25,Fortress ,"Your heart is like a fortress
You keep your feelings locked away
Is it easier?
Does it make you feel safe?

You wander through the darkness
Of wilderness behind your eyes
I know youâ€™re afraid
But you gotta move on

Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe

I believe I know you
Yet I don't truly know myself
I pray you won't feel as alone
As I have felt


I don't want to fail you so
I tell you the awful truth
Everyone faces darkness on their own
As I have done, so will you

Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine

The Earth spins 'round the sun
And behind everything happens
Every night that falls breaks
To sunrise

If your fortress is under siege
You can always run to me
If your fortress is under siege
You can always run


Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine
Come on through
Come on through"

I can go with the flow
Do you believe it in your head?

It's so safe to play along
Little soldiers in a row
Falling in and out of love
With something sweet to throw away

But I want something good to die for
To make it beautiful to live.
I want a new mistake, lose is more than hesitate. 
Do you believe it in your head? 

I can go with the flow
But don't say it doesn't matter, matter anymore 
I can go with the flow

Checkin the station 
The narcotic from me to you 
Just a caught in the medium 
I know you hear it, I hear it too 
It's everywhere that I go 

You come back another day 
And do no wrong 

They say the devil is paranoid 
Always tryin to cover 
But god is leakin through the stereo 
Between the station to station 
You believe it, I know you do 
You won't admit it or say so 
I know that god is in the radio 
Just repeating the slogan 

You come back another day 
And do no wrong

I got hair on my chest
N'I look good without a shirt on

Well, I won't loose my composure in a high-speed chase

I got some drag-strip courage
I can really drive a bed

I'm gonna change my name To Hannibal

Change my name To Hannibal

I know karate, voodoo too
I'm gonna make myself available to you
I don't need no makeup
I got real scars

I look good without a shirt on

Drive all night, get some speed
I'm gonna wait for the sun to shine down on me
I got a hole in my roof 
The shape of a heart

And I'm going out west
Where they appreciate me
Going out west
Where they appreciate me
Going out west
Going out west

Gone..."
78,30,Gonna leave you ,"Wait by the phone 
Late alone

Free is too long

Everything scars the skin 
Push it in, break it off 

I'm gonna leave 
I'm gonna leave you 

I gave it starts 
I stomped on your hearts 
This is the end, 
No more pictures, we ain't friends 
It's raining in my room 
There's blood in my spoon 
You're out of my highchair 
I'm out of your womb 

I'm gonna leave 
I'm gonna leave you 

Free is too long 
You know this is wrong 
Everything scars the skin 
Push it in, push it in, break it off 

I'm gonna leave 
Gonna leave you 

I'm gonna leave 
I don't need you

79,31,Goodbye Yellow Brick Road ,"When are you going to come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man

You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then?
I bet that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road"

Round the hangin tree

There you are 

Round the hangin tree 
Swing in the breeze 
In the summer sun

81,33,Head Like a Haunted House ,"Your head's like a haunted house
A tutti frutti written over the caption
Miss diagnosis a-with-a the mostest
Cue the evil smile
Desperation can led to madness
De-de-degradation is a must
The A, B, C's of leprosy

Need a hand? Take mine
We're subleem, sublime
Fake apologize
Fucks in short supply

Too late, too slick, too young
Bag the gag reflex, spoken tongues
SÃ©ance, say what?
Say man, don't even think about it
Push the pest-aside
Xanadu's and xanadont's
Edumacate me, copulate me
A dirty trick and it's making me sick (Urgh!)

(You okay?) I'm fine
Let's go! Is my sign
We're subleem, sublime
G-g-g-goddamn crime

Tonight
I'm gonna put up a fight
I'm gonna get a reaction that I like
Burn the days
I reject your displays
I demand satisfaction or the knife
To trick the light fantastic, one takes wire on the shins
Petty disguises worn like skins, a distinction, nice
Drink the kool-aid and swallow the pill
You say that you don't and you won't, but you will
Busted

Your head's like a haunted house
Peeping at your mumbo jumbo
Outta sight, going bump in the night
Screwacide
With posterier so superior
Ain't in the race for second place
Circumstances in my pants
Is calling for action
Girl, I'll blow your mind
Then you will blow mine
We're subleem, sublime
Goin' for a ride"

Never ever need to run and hide from me
New prey, soft and easy, tangled forever in my arms

Innocence is what you lose
Like keys and dreams and old tattoos
With one quick twist love turns to scar
Cruising the bruises in my car
Catch the keys, take the wheel and drive, for a while

Hideaway
Hideaway
You'll stay fast and lonely
Never ever need to run and hide from me
New prey, soft and easy, tangled forever in my arms

Hold my hand
You'll feel love

84,36,I appear Missing ,"Calling all comas
Prisoner on the loose
Description:
A spitting image of me
Except for the heart-shaped hole
where the hope runs out

Shock me awake
Tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Prison of sleep
Deepened now
A rabbit hole never to be found
Again

Where are you hiding, my love?
Cast off like a stone, feelings
Raw and exposed when I'm out of control
Pieces were stolen from me
Dare I say, given away
Watching the water give in
As I go down the drain
I appear missing now

I go missing
No longer exist
One day I hope
I'm someone you'd miss

Shock me awake
Tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper I sleep
Further down
A rabbit hole never to be found

It's only falling in love 
Because you hit the ground

Dancing on wire
Both ends are on fire
Cut me loose
Nowhere to run
No more room to pretend
Wandering along the road
In the summer night

I go missing
No longer exist
One day I hope
I'm someone you'd miss

Shock me awake
Tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper I sleep
Further down
A rabbit hole never to be found

I'll fly
With my toes on the edge
It's such a lovely view
Don't cry
I never loved anything until I loved you
Inside
I'm over the edge, what can I do?
Sunshine
I hadn't a thing unless I had you
I'll fly
With my toes on the edge
It's such a lovely view
Don't cry
I never loved anything until I loved you
Inside
I'm over the edge, what can I do?
Sunshine
I've fallen through"

It won't die 

Why you gotta shove it in my face 
As if you put me in my place 
'Cause I don't care 
If you or me is wrong or right 
Ain't gonna spend another night, 
In your bed... 

Laws of man, are just pretend 
They ain't mine 

Love so good, love so bad 
It won't die 

Some talk too long, they know it all 
I just smile and move on 

Words ain't free, like you and me 
I don't mind... 

Why'd you have to be so mean and cruel, 
The dogs are loose i'm on to you 
You ball and
Chained together from the dawn to dusk, 
Can't call it leavin', cause it's just 

I never came...."

And drank a potion, baby, to erase you
Face down in the boulevard
Yet I couldn't face you
There ain't no use in crying
It doesn't change anything
So baby, what good does it do?
Your friends, they all sympathize
Maybe I don't need them too

Imagine I'd be your one and only
Instead of the lonely one

You, me and a lie
Silence is closer
We're passing ships in the night

There's nowhere to run away, said:
""Boy if you want love
You'll have to go and find it with someone new""
""Do you know who you really are?
Are you sure it's really you?""
Lies are a funny thing
They slip through your fingertips
Because they never happened to you
Time wounds all the heals
As we fade out of view

Imagine I'd be your one and only
Instead of the lonely one

You, me and a lie
Silence is closer
We're passing ships in the night

You, me and a lie
Silence is closer
We're passing ships in the night

End to the night
Left with nowhere to hide

Closer and closer
We're crashing ships in the night"

So they tell me so 
Until my head explodes 
Until my headache goes 

Taste so good 
Oh well I knew it would 
Taste so good 
Burn like a match house 
Medicate just to make you soft 
Love is blind 

Can't you release me? (?) 
What the hell were they thinking of? 
You know why

To myself 
Tonight 

Rose, tinted eyes 
Colour my sorrow 
A shade of wine 

Bye bye, black balloon 
I'll see ya real soon 
Wave bye bye 
Bye bye 

Oh why you so sad 
What have they done? 
Forget those mindless baboons 
They're off playing God 

Copy cats in cheap suits 
Are playing it safe 
While cannibals of bad news
Consume the parade 

Is it wonderful? 

Far, far from shore 
Land of the nightmares 
Gone forever more 
And I love you more
That I can control 
I don't even try
Why would I?

Oh why the long face 
You've got it all wrong 
Forget the rat in the race 
We'll choke chain them all 
Fates favour the ones 
Who help themselves 
The rest feel the sting of the lash
As they row, as they row
Row the boat to hell
Row."
97,49,Keep Your Eyes Peeled ,"Don't look, just keep your eyes peeled
Thoughtless, traipsing my mind's field
Shotgun, never behind the wheel anymore
Danger, monsters of smoke and mirror
Slowly, can one so lost be found?

And I know you will never believe
I play this as though I'm alright
If life is but a dream, then
Wake me up

Fallen leaves realize they are no friend of autumn
The view from hell is blue sky
So ominously blue
Daydream until all the blue is gone

And I know you will never believe
I play this as though I'm alright
If life is but a dream
Wake me

Underwater is another life
Disregarding every myth we write
Rag dolls churning
Eagerly alive
Over and over, gasping in horror
So breathless you surface
Just as the next wave is

Big smile, really a show of teeth
Without a care in a world of fear
Lonely, you don't know how I feel
Praise God, nothing is as it seems"

Youâ€™re a truth freak with a lie

In a hotel on the phone 
Youâ€™re gonna leave me, should have known 
And I was thinkin, itâ€™s so sad

What can I say, I am left behind 
So I take a drink, another cigarette 
I canâ€™t forget that you once were mine 

What can I say? 
I guess it wasnâ€™t meant to be 
Now youâ€™re gone, 
Itâ€™s just, your love is like a drug

I just wish that you still were mine"

Just see how far it will bend,
Again and again,

Sometimes the same is different,
but mostly it's the same
these mysteries of life, that just ain't my thing

The only thing I know for sure
Is what I wanna do,
anytime, anywhere and I say

And we're gonna take it cause we love it
Don't you know?

Is this the dose you've been dreamin' of?
A revelation from a gun

Overtaken, mine was yours, now overthrown

Just copulation in a song

Medication for us all

Doesn't matter
All of us cast aside became what has become"

Feast of fools. I can't wait,

Complicate.
Encarcerate.
Feel my heart wake up.

Ain't born to lose baby,
I'm born to win,
I'm so goddamn slick baby, it's a sin,
It's a sin.

Transforming is becoming on me...

Do me first, do your worst.
Gimmie what I want some of.
One track mind, no time to waste.
Sidewalks, feel me strut so good?
Gutter, don't forget this face,
Let 'em taste my misfit love.
I'll show you all my dirty tricks,
Then show 'em again,
I'm so proud of em.
It's cruel to be constantly,
Feel my heart play dumb.

Ain't born to lose baby,
I'm born to win,
I'm so goddamn sick baby, it's a sin,
It's a Sin.

Just a dead man, walking through the dead of night,
And if you are going anywhere tonight? Just a dead end,
Walking through the dead of night and if you are going,
Can I get a ride?
Just a dead man walking through the dead of night,
Its impossible to wait until the light,
Cause, I'm already gone,
If you bet on me, you've won."

Leave you there 
All alone just skin and bone 
When you walk among the trees 
Listening to the leaves 
The further I go the less I know 
The less I know 

Where will you run? 
Where will you hide? 
Lullabies 
To paralyze 

Fat and soft, pink and weak 
Foot and thigh, tongue and cheek 
You know I'm told they swallow you whole 
Skin and bone 
Cutting boards and hanging hooks 
Bloody knives, cooking books 
Promising you won't feel a thing 
At all 

Swallow and chew 
Eat you alive 
All of us food that hasn't died 
And the light says 

Somehow they pick and pluck 
Tenderize bone to dust 
The sweetest grease, finest meat you'll ever taste 
Taste, taste 
So you scream, whine, and yell 
Supple sounds of dinner bells 
We all will feed the worms and trees So don't be shy 

Swallow and chew 
Eat you alive 
All of us food that hasn't died

Dead lifeboats in the sun

Indeed a fool am I....I

But no one knows

A gift that you give to me
No one knows"

There's no reason to pay for it 
It's so easy to see 
And so hard to find 
Make a mountain of a mole hill 
And the mole hill is mine 

I hypnotize you 
And no one can find you 
I blow my load 
Over the status quo 
Here we go 
I'm a little bit nonchalant 
But I dance 
I'm risking it always 
No second chance 

It's gonna be smooth sailing 
From here on out, yeah
I'm gon' do the damage 
'Til the damage is done, yeah

The God only knows 
So mind your behavior 
Follow prescriptions 
Of your bloated savior 
Every temple is gold 
Every hook is designed 
Hell is at the temple 
Of the closed mind 
Closed mind
Closed mind
Closed mind

It's all smooth sailing 
From here on out
Oh, shut up"
126,78,Someone's In The Wolf ,"Once you're lost in twillights's blue
You don't find your way, the way finds you...

Tempt the fates, beware the smile
It hides all the teeth, my dear,
What's behind them...

So glad you could stay
Forever

He steps between the trees, a crooked man
There's blood on the blade
Don't take his hand

You warm by the firelight, in twilight's blue
Shadows creep & dance the walls
He's creeping too..

So glad you could stay
Forever"
127,79,Song For The Deaf ,"Nobodys coming down the hall
Nobody echoes in my head
Broken reflection had a look
Nobody ever needed her

I got what was
I want to take what's left
Ready now

Beautiful senses are gone
Canary in a gilded cage
Singin

Sweet, soft, and low
I will poison you all
Come closer, racing to your turn

I got what was
I want to take what's left
No talk will cure
What's lost, or save what's left
For the deaf

I can go get fucked
Lie beside the ditch
So low round my neck
Strung out every stitch

Who are you hiding
Is it safe for the deaf
Beautiful cancer
Infiltrate and forget
And I saw you coming
And I heard not a thing
A mistake not to listen
When I knew where you'd been

And I got what was
I want to take what's left
No talk will cure
What's lost, or save what's left
For the deaf"
128,80,Suture Up Your Future ,"I'm gonna suture up my future
I ain't jaded, I just hate it
See, Iâ€™ve been down too long
It's kinda hard to explain
Done and buried all I carried

All my evil through a needle
As it pulled through the eye
What was and what will, they're all gone

Don't sweat it, thread it to forget it
To feel like you've already gone
To the rest of, the rest of the life that you've got
Take a picture, bury it all away, bury it all away

Tried to fake it, I just can't take it
I don't care if it hurts
Just so long as it's real

I won't waste it, I turned to face it
That I'd sharpen the knife
Then used it to bone, made it dull

Tried explaining, done explaining
Got caught in the plan
All this talking at once

I've been giving my love away
To the things that tear it apart
I'm gonna suture up my future

Thread to forget it
To feel like you've already gone
To the rest of, the rest of the life that you've got
Tie the loose ends, bury it all away
It's like this, it's like this"
129,81,Tangled Up in Plaid ,"I slipped
Didn't mean
Didn't mean to do it that way
But I blew in on a whim, gone tomorrow
I'm gone today

Come, lets play along
And let each other lose
A win would cause an alarm
Don't matter to me
Don't matter to you

I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So free yourself
I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So free yourself

A self-inflicted wound, your gift
Impeccable aim
Can really clear a room
All the bodies piled up in your way

Oh yeah, so bad

I could keep you all for myself
I know you gotta be free
So free yourself
I could keep you all to myself
I know you gotta be free
To kill yourself"

131,83,The Blood is Love ,"I saw you, in a way
Beyond figure out
These lines of life have been drawn & can't be removed
Our eyes is all it took to know

Open up your eyes
Deep blue, glassy lake
& swim 'til water & sky
Now are one, out of two
Oh, my bloodshot eyes

Open up your mouth
Touch your lips to mine
That we may make a kiss that can pierce through death & survive
Your words have branded my mind

Still i hold your hand
Wrapped as if a ring
We of flesh & blood are only carrying
It's so hard to

Waiting under things
That rise in the morning

Just fingerfucked and
Busted up all at once

I'm so lost out on the highway
With no direction left to go
Everyday sit up and wonder
Where it was I started from

The more you've found
The less you've been around"

Blame all the movement to give it away
You've got somethin, I understand
Holding it tightly, caught on command
Leap of faith, do you doubt?
Cut you in, I just cut you out

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone

Look for reflections, in your face
Canine devotion, time can't erase
Out on the corner, locked in your room
I never believe them and I never assume
Still can't believe there is a lie
Promise is promise, an eye for an eye
We've got something to reveal
No one can know how we feel

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone

How far I'd go not to say

And I'm taking my song to the grave

Human race that we are
Has left me crawling
Staring straight at the sun
All in a moment I notice
Every dog has his day
I paid attention
Cost me so much to hate

For so long
I saw only wrong
But now to remind
It's a waste of time

Close your eyes and see the skies are falling

I wanted something
Nothing blank I don't know
It's hard deflecting
Stones are easy to throw
All in a moment I noticed
Hours, days left behind
Of wasted, useless
Selfless, none of a kind

For so long
I saw only wrong
But now to remind
Not to go back to the low
That has drained my life so long
That has drained my life so long
That has drained my life so long

Close your eyes and see the skies are falling

Not exactly sure anymore
Where's this going to?
Can I follow through?
Or just follow you for a while

Does anyone ever get this right?
I feel no love

And all confusion here
It is as I feared
The illusion that you feel is real
To be vulnerable is needed most of all
If you intend to truly fall apart

You think the worst of all
Is far behind
The vampyre of time and memories has died
I've survived
I speak, I breathe
I'm incomplete
I'm alive, hurray
You're wrong again

139,91,This Lullaby ,"Where, where have you been my love?
Where, where can you be?

It's been so long since the moon has gone
And, oh, what a wreck you made me

Are you lost, over the ocean?
Are you there, up in the sky?

Until the return of my love, this lullaby

My hope is on the horizon
Every face your eyes I can see

I plead and pray through each night and day
Our embrace is only a dream

And sure as days come from moments
Each hour becomes a life's time

When she'd left, I'd only begun this lullaby."

Figure drawn inside a toilet on the wall
The world is round,
My square donâ€™t fit at all

They say those who canâ€™t just instruct others
& act like victims or jilted lovers
You canâ€™t lose it if you never had it
Disappear man. Do some magic

You want a reason ? How is about because
You ainâ€™t a has been if you never was

I sound like this

Scared to say what is your passion
So slag it all
Bitterâ€™s in fashion
Fear of failureâ€™s all youâ€™ve started
The jury is in, VERDICT:
Retarded,
Iâ€™m so tired and Iâ€™m wired too
Iâ€™m a mess I guess Iâ€™m turning on the screw"

I know that life moves on, that's what scares me so

Only us, no one in the world
Only us, no one in the world

I better do something, move earth and sky
And patiently, sweetly, with all of my mind
I sing only for you
To the beat of my footsteps in the night

Close your eyes and dream me home
Forever mine, I'll be forever yours
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore

There's no magic bullet, no cure for pain
What's done is done, 'til you do it again
Life in pursuit of a nameless prey
I've been so close, I'm so far away
It's so hard to explain, so easy to feel
I need you now, nothing is real
Save me from the villains of circumstance
Before I lose my place


Close your eyes and dream me home
Forever mine, I'll be forever yours
I'll be forever yours
I'll be forever yours
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
