0,Ain't No Fun (Waiting Round to be a Millionaire) ,"The following is a true story
Only the names have been changed to protect the guilty

Well, I left my job in my home town and headed for the smoke 
Got a rock 'n' roll band and a fast right hand 
Gonna get to the top 
Nothings gonna stop us, no, nothing

So if you've got the money, we've got the sound 
You put it up, we'll put it down 
If you've got the dollar, we've got the song 
Just wanna boogie woogie all night long, yeah, boogie 

I got holes in my shoes, I got holes in my teeth
I got holes in my socks, I can't get no sleep
I'm trying to make a million

And I got patches on the patches on my old blue jeans
Well, they used to be blue
When they used to be new, when they used to be clean

But I've got a mumma who's a hummer just keeping me alive
While I'm in the band doing drinking with the boys
She's working 9 to 5
She knows her place that woman

Just you wait
One of these days see me driving round town
In my Rock 'n' Rolls Royce with the sun roof down
My bottle of booze, no summer time blues
Shouting out 'look at me' in my rock 'n' roll voice

No it ain't no fun, yeah, waiting round to be a millionaire
No it ain't no fun, waiting round to be a millionaire

Do you believe me?
It ain't no fun, no, waiting round to be a millionaire
It ain't no fun, I don't care what they say
Waiting round to be a millionaire

Drive a Rolls Royce car
No it ain't no fun and you know it
Waiting round to be a millionaire
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ain't no fun
Waiting round to be a millionaire

Got a million dollar scream
But it ain't no fun (ain't no fun), oh no
No it ain't no fun (ain't no fun), that's what I said
But it ain't no fun (ain't no fun) and I wanna be rich
No it ain't no fun (ain't no fun), ain't no fun digging this bitch

Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire, you better believe me
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
No, it ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
No, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun) no, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
I ain't having no fun (ain't no fun), no,  it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire, no no
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
No, it ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire

Hey Hello, Howard, how you doin'?
Next door neighbour
Oh yeah, get your fuckin' jumbo jet off my airport

(Ain't no fun, ain't no fun)
No it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
Hey, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
No, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
No, it ain't no fun, no, it ain't no fun, ain't no fun
(Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire) no, no, no
(Ain't no fun, ain't no fun, ain't no fun)"
1,All Screwed Up ,"Young - Young) 
Get ready 
You think your kinda tough 
You're walkin' kinda rough 
When you want any more 
You go fast wo' wo' wo' 
Things go tough 
And you strut your stuff 
And I want your thing 
Then you're out of luck 
Yes you are 

It's all screwed up 
All screwed up

Take you out to kick some butt 
Work you over screw you nuts

Then she push you out that door 
And things go hard

She can pack some punch 
Then you're out to lunch, back at one 

It's all screwed up

3,Anything goes ,"Got a taste of a rocking band,
Standing there holding out your hand,
Better lock up all your doors,
She’s like a spinning dynamo,
You’re handing out the token prize,
Giving you a brand new ride,

Ooh there she goes, she goes,
And nobody knows where she goes,

Banging drums, working out all fast,
Heavy tune I can play it loud,
You know she’s blowing away all the others,
You’re never man enough take it on all night,
You better razzle dazzle on that stage,
Keep on rocking all through the night,

Ooh there she goes, she goes,
And nobody knows,
Where she goes she goes,

A heavy rocking tune is playing,
Playing as the night rolls on,
Sneaking off with the Romeo,
Where she goes, nobody knows

(Guitar Solo)

A heavy rocking tune is playing on a flat screen colour TV,
Sneaking over creepy crawly, never give it up to take it out through the night,

There she goes she goes, and nobody knows,
There she goes she goes, and nobody knows,
Where she goes she goes, and nobody knows,
Where she goes she goes, and nobody knows,
Where she goes she goes"
4,Are you ready ,"Are you ready? 
Are you ready?! 
Are you ready?

Sweet apple pie 
Standing in the street

When you feel her sting 
She make you fly 
And you know you're coming! 

Who all need it? - Who

Because that's her thing.

And you know you're broken in! 

Who all need it, who all need it?

Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack 
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap

7,Back in business ,"Breakin' out, about to shout 
Feel the need for one more round 
Don't you struggle, don't try to bite 
You want some trouble, I'm the king of vice 
I'm a wreckin' ball, I'm a stingin' knife 
Steal your money, gonna take your life 
You got screamin' murder, lock up your door 
Double dealin' gotta have more 
Call me dirty, trash my name 
Just tell (the? my?) boys that I'm gonna be 

CHORUS: 
Back in business again 
Back in business again 
Back in business again 
Back in business again 

(Back in business) 

Flesh and blood, I'm a rag 'n' bone 
Bad luck message on the telephone 
Don't you worry, play my game 
I'll do you a favor, put your soul for sale 
Like a cannon ball, goin' down the track 
Need good lovin' but I want it back 
I was born in trouble, they gave up on me 
Teacher preachin' what not to be 
Call me dirty, trash my name 
Just tell my boys that I'm gonna be

8,Back seat confidential ,"Old man's car on a Saturday night
Got me a woman, me, I feel alright
Rockin' and a-rollin' at the drive-in show
Gonna sit in the back, in the passion row
Turn up the soundtrack, turn down the lights
A chance she won't, a chance she might
Ain't no woman in the world I know
Ain't had her knickers on the automobile floor

What's that social sound
Something's goin' down
Look at what's goin' around
Back seat confidential

Said to buy my rubber at the cigarette stand
Dyin' to get it off so I can get it in
Doin' my best to make a good connection
She said, What are you gonna do about my protection
Alright momma, gotta listen to me
Last chance thrill, it's half past three
Huggin' and a-kissin' would be real nice
Every man's got his price

What's that social sound
Something's goin' down
Look at what's goin' around
Back seat confidential

[guitar solo]

Old man's car on a Saturday night
Got me a woman, me, I feel alright
Rockin' and rollin' at the drive-in show
Gonna sit in the back, in the passion row
Turn up the soundtrack, turn down the lights
There's a chance she won't, but there's a chance she might
Ain't no woman in the world I know
Ain't had her knickers on the backseat floor

What's that social sound
Something's goin' down
Look at what's goin' around
Turn around

9,Bad boy boogie ,"On the day I was born the rain fell down 
There was trouble brewing in my home town 
It was the seventh day, I was the seventh son 
And it scared the hell out of everyone 

They said stop, I said go 
They said fast, I said slow 
They said yes, I said no 
I do the bad boy boogie 

Being a bad boy ain't that bad 
I've had me more dirty women than most men ever had 
All you women come along with me 
And I'll show you how good a bad boy can be 

I said right and they said left 
I said east and they said west 
I said up and they said down 
I do the bad boy boogie all over town 

I wanna tell you no story, tell you no lie 
I was born to love till the day I die 
I just line them up and I knock them down 
And they all came running when the word got round 
(Just keep a running) 

I said up, they said down 
They said straight, I said round 
They said lost, I said found 
I said free and they said bound 
Bad boy boogie"

Evil talking bandit man

13,Beating around the bush ,"Smiling face and laughing eyes 
But you keep on telling me all those lies 
How do you expect me to believe 
Honey I ain't that naive 
Baby I got my eye on you 
Cause you do all the things that I want you to 
Stop your crying and dry your tears 
I ain't that wet behind the ears 

You can throw me lefts 
And you can throw me rights 
but where was you last night 
Beating around the bush 

Wish I knew what's on your mind 
Why you're being so unkind? 
Remember those nights we spent alone? [...of stayin' alone] 
Talking on the telephone 
Thoughts of you [go | goin'] through my brain 
You told me that you felt the same 
You told me that you love me too (?) 
Tell me who was there with you? 

I was talking birds 
And you was talking bees 
Was he was down upon his knees 
Beating around the bush 

You're the meanest woman I've ever known 
Sticks and stones won't break my bones 
I know what you're looking for 
[You ate | you've eaten] your cake, you want some more 
I'm gonna give you just a one more chance 
Try to save our romance 
I've done everything I'm gonna do 
The rest is up to you 

You can chew it up 
And you can spit it out 
Let it all hang out 
Beating around the bush 

Oh. 
Chew it up 
Spit it out 
Let it all hang out 
Beating around the bush"
14,Bedlam in Belgium ,"The blood in my veins 
Was running right through my brain 
There was a cop with a gun 
Who was running around insane 
Three fifty arrests 
No bullet proof vests
Now ain't that a shame 
We wanted to play 
Play for the crowd 
Law said: ""no way 
'Cause you're on your way out"" 

Bedlam in Belgium 
Bedlam in Belgium 

The place was a jumpin' 
And the booze was going down 
There's a curfew in town 
You've been working overtime 
We don't play just for pay 
So we'd like to stay 
Stay just the same 
He gave me a crack 
In the back with his gun 
I bled so bad 
I could feel the blood run 

Bedlam in Belgium 
It was bedlam in Belgium 
Bedlam in Belgium 
Came for a good time 
Left on the run. 
Bedlam in Belgium 
Who's to blame, it's a shame 

Bedlam in Belgium 
It was bedlam 
You gonna run out 

Stage was stage 
Cops enraged 
Crying for more 
It was war, war, war 

Bedlam in Belgium 
It was bedlam in Belgium 
Bedlam in Belgium 
Came for a good time 
Left on the run. 
Bedlam in Belgium 
It was bedlam in Belgium 
There was bedlam in Belgium 
It was bedlam 
And the law got the drop on me"
15,Big Balls ,"Well, I'm upper upper class high society
God's gift to ballroom notoriety 
And I always fill my ballroom, the event is never small 
The social pages say I've got the biggest balls of all 

I've got big balls, I've got big balls 
They're such big balls and they're dirty big balls
And he's got big balls and she's got big balls
But we've got the biggest balls of them all

And my balls are always bouncing 
My ballroom always full 
And everybody cums and cums again 
If your name is on the guest list no one can take you higher 
Everybody says I've got great balls of fire 

I've got big balls, oh, I've got big balls 
They're such big balls, dirty big balls
And he's got big balls and she's got big balls
But we've got the biggest balls of them all

Some balls are held for charity and some for fancy dress 
But when they're held for pleasure they're the balls that I like best 
My balls are always bouncing to the left and to the right 
It's my belief that my big balls should be held every night 

We've got big balls, we've got big balls
We've got big balls, dirty big balls
He's got big balls, she's got big balls
But we've got the biggest balls of them all
We've got big balls
(We've got big balls)

But we've got the biggest balls of them all

19,Bonny ,"The song in question is Loch Lomond,
which goes something like the following:

I'll take the high road
And you'll take the low road
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye
But me and my true love
Will never meet again
On the bonny, bonny banks of Loch Lomond

Here is the complete song....

By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes,
Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomon'.
Where me and my true love were ever wont to gae
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomon'.
O ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak the low road,
An' I'll be in Scotland afore ye;
But me and my true love will never meet again
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomon'.
'Twas there that we parted in yon shady glen,
On the steep, steep side o' Ben Lomon',
Where in purple hue the Hieland hills we view,
An' the moon comin' out in the gloamin'.
O ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak the low road,
An' I'll be in Scotland afore ye;
But me and my true love will never meet again
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomon'.

Or sell my wares hauntin' hotel bars

21,Born To Be Wild ,"Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway
Lookin' for adventure
And whatever comes our way
Yeah Darlin' go make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space

I like smoke and lightning
Heavy metal thunder
Racin' with the wind
And the feelin' that I'm under
Yeah Darlin' go make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space

Like a true nature's child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never wanna die

Born to be wild
Born to be wild

Get your motor runnin'
Head out on the highway

22,Borrowed time ,"Got the word, getting ready 
Gonna get my pay from ???? 
I'm in light, ???? 
When the action is hot, ???? 
No town, no city 
Gonna be free from the jumping jack 
Kiss of life, getting gritty 
If the mule don't kick you know the mule don't ride 
And I know, yes I know, well I know 
That's the way to go 
And I know, and I know 
And I know that I'm gonna get it down the road

Cause I'm living on a borrowed time 
Do it your way, I'll do it mine 
Living on a borrowed time 
Don't need a shove, don't need a sign 

Call me names, call me crazy 
Don't try to stop me when I feel this way 
It's a game, (whoopsy daisy?) 
Here comes another girl to make my day 
And I know, yes I know, well I know 
That's the way to go 
And I know, yes I know 
I'm gonna get up when I'm up on the road

23,Brain shake ,"Alright, hold tight 
I want to ball tonight 
On my fender, no space defender 
I enjoy it on the floor, I get it tight 
Toe to toe with a black widow 
Fee Fia Foo smell the blood of rock 'n' roll 
All night drive on the rockin' suicide 
My feet are jumping, she's a joy to ride 
Joy to ride, a joy to ride 
She's an all night drive on the rockin' suicide 

And it's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake 
All I can take 
Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake 

She's a mean lean rocking machine 
A hip hugging blue jean dream 
She's a one course dinner, with a sweet sweet kiss 
Her hips are right around me 
And it's toe to toe with a black widow 
Fee Fia Foo smell the blood of rock 'n' roll 
All night drive on the rockin' suicide 
My feet are jumping, she's a joy to ride 
Joy to ride, a joy to ride 
She's an all night drive on the rockin' suicide 

And it's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake 
Ready to shake 
Brain shake, brain shake, brain shake 

It's a brain shake brain shake brain shake 
For mercy sake 
It's a brain shake, brain shake, brain shake

She's an all night drive on the rockin' suicide 

Brain shake x3

24,Breaking the rules ,"Black sheep and a renegade 
Hot feet in the cool of the shade 
Street shuffle and a tough childhoods 
Examinations done no good 
Crow bars and a hot wired cars 
Sneak thieves and cheap cigars 
No rebellion, not today 
I get my kicks in my own way 
Right, OK 

Just keep on breaking the rules 
Come on, get ready to rule 

Tough breaks in the neighbourhood 
A hard case who's up to no good 
Living like trash, a society rash 
Ready to break, and ready to dash 
A bad deal and a real rough ride 
You're doing time on the other side 
No rebellion, not today 
I get my kicks in my own way 
Right, OK 

Just keep on breaking the rules 
Come on, get ready to rule 

(Tough breaks) 

They got regulation ties 
Regulation shoes 
Those regulation fools 
With their regulation rules 

Just keep on breaking the rules 
Come on, get ready to rule 

Oh take off your ties and your regulation shoes 
You're nothing but a bunch of regulation fools 
And you got your regulation rules 
I'm going to do things my own way 
Every day and every way"

Cream of a dream is the cause of the itch

The crime of the day is when you do it again 
Call of the doctor, cash on demand 
If you give them a finger, they'll take off your hand 

CHORUS

Call of a dog, cry of a bitch

It's the curse of love"

You know it give me a thrill 
And she's tailor made to order

And you won't need a doctor

30,Carry me home ,"The bartender's working on a late night shift 
She's bonka blonds and Bon aims on a midnight drift 
And the dance band's playing the same old slam 
I'm sinking whiskey and you're sipping fine wine 
I don't know what it is you're trying to prove 
Well it should be you but it's me who can hardly move 
And I've got my reputation lying on the line 
Come on baby, be a good dog and help the blind 

Won't you carry me home 
(Like a truck, pick me up) 

You ain't no lady but you've sure got taste in men 
That head of yours has got you by time and time again 
My arms and legs are aching and my head's about to blow 
And your back's been breakin' and I'd hate to spoil the show 
But I've just spent next weeks wages and I'm right out of coin 
But you want more and it's half past four and they want to close the joint 
But we can't afford a taxi, and it's too late for the bus 
But I've been told by friends of mine you're someone I can trust 

Carry me home 
Won't you carry me home 
Carry me home 
(Don't let me lie here in all this beer) 

You drank all your booze and half of mine 
I'm bleary eyed and you're waiting for the sunshine (to come and kill me) 
Just like the man who threw me on the floor 
Don't matter, while I'm down here I might as well try and find the fucking door 
Excuse me, have you seen it? It's about this big 
And have you got a plastic bag 'cause I'm gonna be sick 
I'm dead drunk and heave'n hanging upside down 
And you're getting up and leaving, you think I'm gonna drown 

Carry me home 
Won't you carry me home (can you help) 
Carry me home 

Carry me home 
Won't you carry me home 
Carry me home"

Bad cards in a bad hand

Out drivin' in a big truck 
And maybe I'll get beat up 

Caught with your pants down

Raising up insanity
Feeling like the old-time blues

Slipping on a waterfall
Better turn off that tune

Speeding up the road
Tearing up the highway code

Ain't coming up late
And hit the brakes
Don't mess with fate

33,Cold Hearted Man ,"No one knew 
Where he came from 
He never knew himself 
Call her Ma 
Call him Pa 
But he was born to someone else 
No one fooled 
Or messed him around 
Cause they were all afraid 
Ain't no lies 
Ice in the eyes 
Of Leeroy Kincaid 

CHORUS: 
Cold hearted man 
One time lover heart in his hand 
Cold hearted man 
And you can't trust nothing you don't understand 
Cold hearted man 
Cold hearted man 

Like a snake 
He had no friends 
He didn't need no one 
Hurt his pride 
Deep inside 
He was another mother's son 
Reputation 
Broken glass 
Everybody prayed 
For their lives on the street 
Where they happened to meet 
Leeroy Kincaid 

CHORUS 

Sometimes you can't see 
The other side 
It's too well hidden 
For the naked eye 
One time lover 
With his heart in his hand 
Two time loser 
A broken man 

Cold hearted man"

And they crawled around 
Walking sideways 
Sideway walking

And you start to scratch 
When they start to hatch 
Walking sideways 
Sideway walking 
Give me the blues 

But when they start to bite 
Then it's time you set alight 
For an appointment 
Before you start to scream 
That's when you apply the cream 
Blues ointment 

Well the doctor said 
""We got to make 'em dead"" 
Walking sideways 
Sideway walking 
Give me the blues 

And when you start to scream 
That's when you apply the cream 
Blues ointment 
And when they start to itch 
You go out and you take a bitch 
For an appointment 

Well you rub it on 
And you rub it in 
Stops them walking

Gives them the blues 

Sideway walking

With his evil lips
Great guns are blazin'

Yeah, raised by a jackal, raised a bad seed
You better look around before you hit the ground
Give me no quarrel, lives of crime

Like a devil on a deadline
Gonna send you down

Demon fire is all you desire
Demon fire, it glows sapphire

Seeking out power, girl, I'll hunt you down
Blowin' out on a flash, gonna knock you out
You better look around
Hear the evil sound
Give me no quarrel, drenched in grime

With all the bad intentions
Gonna send you down

Demon fire is all you desire
Demon fire, it glows in its fire
Demon fire, flames burn higher
Demon fire, it's an all-out hellfire

44,Destiny ,"In this world there's so much confusion
And I've tasted the city life and it's not for me
Now I do dream of distant places
Where I don't know now, but it's Destiny

If it's the rich life, I don't want it
Happiness ain't always material things

I want Destiny
It's the place for me
Give me the simple life
I'm getting away from here
Let me be free, let me be me

I'm a man that's for all seasons
What the city offers me ain't naturally
I look to greet the stars
But there's no stars to see
Gonna search this world until I find my Destiny

If it's the rich life, I don't want it
Happiness ain't always material things

I want Destiny
It's the place for me
Give me the simple life
I'm getting away from here
Let me be free, let me be me

I'm a man that's for all seasons
What the city offers me ain't naturally
I look to greet the stars
But there's no stars to see
Gonna search this world until I find my Destiny

I want to be far from here
Should I up and fly away so fancy free
Nobody can change my mind
I'm screamming out these words for me
While time
Destiny, ah destiny, it's calling me
Destiny, a place for me
Ah, destiny
I want destiny
It's the place for me......

Got nothing to lose 
Run out of money 
Disposable blues 
Sleazy hotels 
Like living in hell 
The girls on the hustle 
With nothing to sell 
Want something for nothing 
It's always the same 
Keep pushing and shoving 
And I'm down on the game 
Always in trouble 
Forever detained 

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
And good riddance to bad luck 

Well spread out the news 
There's a free man loose 
Back out of jail 
And chasing some flooze 
Bad luck has changed 
Broken the chains 
Lay down a claim 
For monetary gains 
Wonder what's coming 
Out for the take 
Freedom for loving 
And lust for the taste 
Eyes are wide open 
Wild to the game 

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye 
And good riddance to bad luck 

Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Sometimes I think this woman is sometimes not 
Puts me down, fools me around 
What's she doing to me? 
Out for satisfaction, any piece of action 
That ain't the way it should be 
She needs love, smells out a man 
She's gotta see 
Pours my beer, licks my ear 
Brings out the devil in me 

Hell ain't a bad place to be 

Spends my money, drinks my booze, stays out every night 
And I got to thinking, ""Hey, just a minute, something ain't right"" 
Disillusions and confusion 
Make me want to cry 
All the same, you lead your games 
Tellin' me your lies 
Don't mind her playing a demon 
As long as it's with me 
If this is hell then you could say 
It's heavenly 

Hell ain't a bad place to be 

Late at night turns down the lights 
Closes up on me 
Opens my heart, tears it apart 
Brings out the devil in me 

Hell ain't no bad place to be"

88,It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll ) ,"Ridin' down the highway
Goin' to a show
Stoppin' on the byways
Playin' rock 'n' roll
Gettin' robbed
Gettin' stoned
Gettin' beat up
Broken bones
Gettin' had
Gettin' took
I tell you, folks
It's harder than it looks

It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll 
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll

If you think it's easy doin' one night stands 
Try playin' in a rock roll band 
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll

Make you wanna cry
Ladies do the hard sell
Know the reason why
Gettin' old
Gettin' grey
Gettin' ripped off
Underpaid
Gettin' sold
Second hand
That's how it goes
Playin' in a band

It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll 
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll 

If you wanna be a star of stage and screen 
Look out
It's rough and mean 

It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll 
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll

89,Jailbreak ,"There was a friend of mine on murder 
And the judge's gavel fell 
Jury found him guilty 
Gave him sixteen years in hell 
He said ""I ain't spending my life here 
I ain't living alone 
Ain't breaking no rocks on the chain gang 
I'm breakin' out and headin' home 

Gonna make a jailbreak 
And I'm lookin' towards the sky 
I'm gonna make a jailbreak 
Oh, how I wish that I could fly 

All in the name of liberty 
All in the name of liberty 
Got to be free 

Jailbreak, let me out of here 
Jailbreak, sixteen years 
Jailbreak, had more than I can take 
Jailbreak, yeah"" 

He said he'd seen his lady being fooled with 
By another man 
She was down and he was up 
He had a gun in his hand 
Bullets started flying everywhere 
And people started to scream 
Big man lying on the ground 
With a hole in his body 
Where his life had been 
But it was - 

All in the name of liberty 
All in the name of liberty 
I got to be free 

Jailbreak, jailbreak 
I got to break out 
Out of here 

Heartbeats they were racin' 
Freedom he was chasin' 
Spotlights, sirens, rifles firing 
But he made it out 
With a bullet in his back"
90,Johnny B. Goode ,"Deep down Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar just like a ringing a bell

Go go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineerswould see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play

Go go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Go Johnny go
Go
Johnny B. Goode

His mother told him ""Someday you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big old band.
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight.""

Go go
Go Johnny go
Go go go Johnny go
Go go go Johnny go
Go go go Johnny go
Go

96,Let there be rock ,"In the beginning 
Back in nineteen fifty-five 
Man didn't know about a rock 'n' roll show 
And all that jive 
The white man had the schmaltz 
The black man had the blues 
No one knew what they was gonna do 
But Tchaikovsky had the news 
He said - 

""Let there be sound"", and there was sound 
""Let there be light"", and there was light 
""Let there be drums"", and there was drums 
""Let there be guitar"", and there was guitar 
""Let there be rock"" 

And it came to pass 
That rock 'n' roll was born 
All across the land every rockin' band 
Was blowing up a storm 
The guitarman got famous 
The businessman got rich 
And in every bar there was a super star 
With a seven year itch 
There were fifteen million fingers 
Learning how to play 
And you could hear the fingers picking 
And this is what they had to say 

""Let there be light"" 
""Sound"" 
""Drums"" 
""Guitar"" 
""Let there be rock"" 

One night in a club called `The Shaking Hand' 
There was a ninety-two decibel rocking band 
The music was good and the music was loud 
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd - 

""Let there be rock"""

And when I turn on my tv, the fuckin' Brady Bunch
The cluelessness of middle class is what I'm living for
In San Jose there's too many dicks, it's a bore, a bore
My parents are getting stressed, just give my ears a rest
I wake in time to go to school to take another test
No more
It's such a total waste, don't worry about me I'll set my own pace.

And I ain't met no one who told me I got class 
They say never feed the animal, the boy's got too much flash 
I'm a guy they just can't teach 
And I always kick the castle that's been built up on the beach (heh ha) 

Animal, animal 
Cannibal, cannibal 
See 'em fall, see 'em fall 
Cause I'm the guy that they call - 

What's your name?

Take my chances, I don't wanna die 
Count ten, just pray 
The nick of time can save me any day

Everybody love a hero, honey 
Living on a danger line 
Saved by, saved in the nick of time 
Yeah, saved in the nick of time 

Lose sleep, get grief 
Some day get no relief 
Quick punch, closed eye 
You didn't knew it and you wonder why 
Lynch mob on your tail 
Think they were searching for the holy grail 
Leave town, get away

No I didn't today

Money gone, left high and dry 

Need no excuse 
To let it all hang loose 
My body's for abuse 

CHORUS 
(Gonna end up torn to shreds) 

Don't need no excuse 
My body's for abuse 

CHORUS 

Rise, rise 
I'm gonna rise 
Rising power 
The power rise from you"
130,Rock 'n' Roll Singer  ,"My daddy was workin' nine to five
When my momma was havin' me 
By the time I was half alive 
They knew what I was gonna be 
But I left school and grew my hair 
They didn't understand 
They wanted me to be respected as a doctor or a lawyer man 
But I had other plans

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer 
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll star 
Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll, a rock 'n' roll star

Well, I worked real hard and bought myself a rock 'n' roll guitar 
I gotta be on top some day 
I wanna be a star 
I can see my name in lights and I can see the queue 
I got the devil in my blood tellin' me what to do 
And I'm all ears

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll, a rock 'n' roll star
I hear it pays well

Well, you can stick your nine to five livin' 
And you collar and your tie 
And stick your moral standards 'cause it's all a dirty lie 
You can stick your golden handshake 
And you can stick your silly rules 
And all the other shit that they teach to kids in school 
Cause I ain't no fool

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll star
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer
I'm gonna be a rock 'n' roll, a rock 'n' roll star

Gonna be a rock 'n' roll singer

Busted man on show (?) 
Bundled out of the City, out of the door 
Thrown up against the wall 
Put out of the picture, axe about to fall 
Walk before you throw (cry?) 
Sinking to the bottom, screaming for air 
The shark must get his share 
You can see it coming, miles and miles away 
Women, drink and money are going to make you pay 

Snowballed, oh yeah 
Snowballed, they've done it again 
Snowballed, makin' me pay

Howl of the wolf, snear (snow??) in his eyes 
Waiting to take you by surprise 
Eye of the needle, head of the pin 
Watch those teeth 'cause they're ready to bite 
You can see it coming, miles and miles away 
Women, drink and money are going to make you pay

Don't make the news 'til they're doin' time

Run up a score, oooh the price is right
Dealers looking round, wheel is turning round
Coming round on you
CHORUS:
Some sin for gold
Some sin for shame
Some sin for cash
Some sin for gain
Some sin for wine
Some sin for pain
But I ain't gonna be the fool
Who's gonna have to sin for nothing
Nothin' at all
Nero, evil mind
He was born way before his time
Lead 'em down below
You got it right and away you go
You gotta lay down the rules, push up the price
Turn on the heat, put you on ice
Dealers looking round, wheel is turning round
Coming round for you

163,Sometimes ,"I got your message
It screamed aloud
Your dancing and your singing
Gave it a shroud
We all may have laughed
As they dragged us down
Now all the clear is mundane
With a broken, crooked crown

Sometimes
I don't feel your love
Sometimes
I can only hope to stay alive
Sometimes
You come and take me away

I feel like the chatter
Cleared my head
But always your ways
Left me better off for dead

The chance of reason shook
Away the way
Now all is a Sunday
For a man who's lost his way

Sometimes
I don't feel your love
Sometimes
I can only hope to stay alive
Sometimes
You come and take me away

Don't lean back too far
As the colors fade to gray
Don't breathe in too much
Or the weight will blow you away

Do you give a little in?
All that's left is sometimes right
Your happiness danced away
Far away...
To the distance in the twilight

Sometimes
I don't feel your love
Sometimes
I can only hope to stay alive
Sometimes
You come and take me away"
164,Soul Stripper ,"Well I met her in the garden
Underneath that old apple tree
Sitting with a handful of flowers
Looking as cool as can be
We talked away a couple of hours
Then she laid her hand on my lap
Oh I thought I got to be dreaming
I didn't know I fell in her trap

Then she made me say things I didn't want to say
Then she made me play games I didn't want to play
She was a soul stripper, yeah
She took my heart
She was a soul stripper, ooh
And tore me apart

She started moving nice and easy
Slowly getting near to my spine
Killing off each last little feeling
Ooh everyone she could find
And when she had me hollow and naked, yeah
That's when she put me down
Pulled out a knife and flashed it before me
Stuck it in and turned it around

Then she made me say things I didn't want to say, you know
Then she made me play games I didn't want to play
She was a soul stripper, yeah
Ooh she took my heart
Ooh was a soul stripper
Tore me apart

Soul stripper, soul stripper
You're a soul stripper
Soul stripper, soul stripper
Soul stripper
Took out my heart
And tore it apart

Aah you're a soul stripper
Soul stripper, soul stripper"
165,Spellbound ,"Blinded by a bright beam 
Shattered by the windscreen 
Stunned by the whiplash 
I'm a victim of a bad crash 
I can do nothing right 
I never sleep at night 
Can't even start a fight 
My feet have left the ground 
Spinning round and round 

Spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling down 

Beaten by a blind man 
Wrong way up a dead end 
Screaming through a speed trap 
As I tear into a tail pipe 
I can do nothing right 
I never sleep at night 
Can't even start a fight 
My feet have left the ground 
Spinning round and round 

Spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling down 

I'm slipping down 
I got my hands in the fire 

I'm sliding on an oil slick 
Blinded on a bad trip 
Yes and nothing's going to change it 
I can do nothing right 
Can't even sleep at night 
My feet have left the ground 
I'm spinning round and round 

Spellbound, my world keeps a tumbling down"

186,Touch too much ,"It was one of those nights
When you turned out the lights 
And everything comes into view
She was taking her time
I was losing my mind
There was nothing that she wouldn't do
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
She knew we was making love
I was so satisfied
Deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove

CHORUS 
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She's got a touch, a touch too much

She had the face of an angel
Smiling with sin, A body of Venus with arms
Dealing with danger
Stroking my skin
Like a thunder and lightning storm
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard
And wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare

CHORUS  
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane.
She's got a touch, a touch too much

Touch me!

Seems like a touch (touch too much) 
You know it's much too much (much too much) 
I really want to feel your (touch too much)

Is where I'm gonna fall 
Ace high 
Hide your poker eyes

Standing at my side

Love the way you girls work out 
And make the partnership

Riding in cars
Never gonna give it for free
You're pumping with a view
On the finest avenue
Looking at your beat on the street

Satisfied with nothing

So stop your loving and roll
All your digging for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder, I wonder

Honey, what you do for money?
Honey, what you do for money?
Where you get your kicks?

You're loving on the take
And you're always on the make
Squeezing all the blood out of men
They're all standing in a queue
Just to spend the night with you
It's business as usual again
You're always grabbing, stabbing
Trying to get it back in
But girl you must be getting slow

So stop your loving and roll
All your digging for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder, I wonder

Running out of chicks, you got no line in the naked town 
So don't look down, no 

CHORUS 

Ain't nobody told you, who made who?"
196,Whole lotta rosie ,"Wanna tell you a story 
'Bout a woman I know 
When it comes to lovin' 
Oh she steals the show 
She ain't exactly pretty 
Ain't exactly small 
Forty-two, thirty-nine, fifty-six 
You could say she's got it all 

Never had a woman 
Never had a woman like you 
Doing all the things 
Doing all the things you do 
Ain't no fairy story 
Ain't no skin and bone 
But you give it all you got 
Weighing in at nineteen stone 

CHORUS: 
You're a whole lotta woman 
A whole lotta woman 
Whole lotta Rosie 
Whole lotta Rosie 
Whole lotta Rosie 
And you're a whole lotta woman 

Oh honey you can do it 
Do it to me all night long 
Only one to turn 
Only one to turn me on 
All through the night time 
And right around the clock 
To my surprise 
Rosie never stops 

CHORUS"
197,Wild Reputation ,"In a one-horse town
They try to pull you down
And make you feel out of place
Don't care to look in your face
Ooh

Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Hey, hey, ooh, yeah

On a hot, summer day
Dollar bills come your way
Somebody robbed the bank, ooh
They picked you out of the ranks, hey

Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation

(Oh, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
You better keep away
(Oh, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
Don't get in my face, oh, yeah
(Oh, oh, yeah, hey, yeah)

When I'm comin' down Main Street
Get outta my way
I ain't stoppin' for nobody

Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation
Got a wild reputation, wild, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Gotta keep away (Hey, yeah)
I ain't stoppin' for nobody (Oh, yeah)
I've got a wild reputation (Hey, yeah)"
198,Witch's Spell ,"Let me tell you your fortune
It could be sinister or maybe not
Like a leopard, can't change its own spots

Ride a moonbeam
Sail the starlight
A blaze in the night sky
See the witch's flight

Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell

Good time maker who likes it hot
Like a card-playin' shark who takes the whole lot
(And that's a lot)

Ride a moonbeam
Sail the starlight
A blaze in the night sky
See the witch's flight

[Chorus]
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell

It's all coming to ya
It's all coming through ya
I get bathed in the light
The spell's just right

Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell
Got a tale to tell
Caught in a witch's spell

Crystal balls and an almanac
She gonna take you to hell and back
I've got potions, snake oil style
Good luck charms and a witch's spell"
199,You ain't got a hold on me ,"You can roll me 
round your finger 
You can roll me if I'm blind 
You can roll me tally ho ho, 
I'm easy rollin' kind. 
But don't think I'm facin' down hill, 
'Cause you'll soon see, 
You'll lose your grip and slip, 
'Cause you ain't got a hold on me. 

Chorus: 
You ain't got a hold on me, 
You ain't got a hold on me, 
Why don't you let me free, 
'Cause you ain't got a hold on me. 

You can take me to your bedroom, 
You can take me to your heart, 
You can take me to a climax, 
I won't fall apart. 
But don't count on me givin' it 
All back to you, 
Just because I'm hooked on livin' 
Doesn't mean I'm hooked on you."
200,You can'n stop rock'n'roll ,"Don't you give me no line
Better run if you can
Just like a thorn in the side
So don't give me no

Don't you give me no
Don't you give me no
Don't you give me no lies

You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll

Don't you play me no jive
A bit of fun on the side
Too much clap make you blind
So don't give me no

Don't you give me no
Don't you give me no
Don't you give me no lines

You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
I said, ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
Listen everybody say
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll
I said you can't stop rock 'n' roll
You can't stop rock 'n' roll"
201,You shook Me all night long ,"She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
And knockin' me out with those American thighs

Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching and we were making it
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more

Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you, shook me all night long
Yeah, you, shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You, shook me all night long
You had me shaking and you
Shook me all night long

Yeah, you shook me
Well you took me

You really took me and you
Shook me all night long
Ah, you
Shook me all night long
Yeah yeah, you
Shook me all night long

You really got me and you, shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night long"
