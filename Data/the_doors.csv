1,A feast of friends ,"Wow, Im sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain
South
Cruel bindings.
The servants have the power
Dog-men and their mean women
Pulling poor blankets over
Our sailors

Im sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the tv
Tower, I want roses in
My garden bower; dig? 
Royal babies, rubies
Must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal
For the plant thats plowed.

They are waiting to take us into
The severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful
Comes death on a strange hour
Unannounced, unplanned for
Like a scaring over-friendly guest youve
Brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
And gives us wings
Where we had shoulders
Smooth as ravens
Claws

No more money, no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
Until its other jaw reveals incest
And loose obedience to a vegetable law.

I will not go
Prefer a feast of friends
To the giant family"
2,A little game ,"Once I had a little game 
I liked to crawl back in my brain 
I think you know the game I mean 
I mean the game called ""go insane"" 

Now you should try this little game 
Just close your eyes, forget you name 
Forget the world, forget the people 
And we`ll erect a different steeple 

This little game is fun to do 
Just close your eyes, no way to loose 
And I`m right here, I`m going too 
Release control, we`re breaking through "
3,Across The Sea ,"Come, ride with me
Across the sea.
Endlessly.

So happy we will be
Across the sea.
Endlessly.
"
4,Adolf Hitler ,"Adolf Hitler is still alive 
Ooooogh - sssssh 
I slept with her last night 
yeah 
Come out from behind 
that false mustache, Adolf 
I know your’re in there 
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
You favor life 
He sides with Death 
I straddle the fence 
And my balls hurt "
5,Alabama Song (Whisky Bar) ,"Well, show me the way 
To the next whisky bar 
Oh, don't ask why 
Oh, don't ask why 

Show me the way 
To the next whisky bar 
Oh, don't ask why 
Oh, don't ask why 

For if we don't find 
The next whisky bar 
I tell you we must die 
I tell you we must die 
I tell you, I tell you 
I tell you we must die 

Oh, moon of Alabama 
We now must say goodbye 
We've lost our good old mama 
And must have whisky, oh, you know why 

Oh, moon of Alabama 
We now must say goodbye 
We've lost our good old mama 
And must have whisky, oh, you know why 

Well, show me the way 
To the next little girl 
Oh, don't ask why 
Oh, don't ask why 

Show me the way 
To the next little girl 
Oh, don't ask why 
Oh, don't ask why 

For if we don't find 
The next little girl 
I tell you we must die 
I tell you we must die 
I tell you, I tell you 
I tell you we must die 

Oh, moon of Alabama 
We now must say goodbye 
We've lost our good old mama 
And must have whisky, oh, you know why"
6,American night ,"All hail the American night! 
What was that? 
I don't know 
Sounds like guns...thunder. 
(Roadhouse Blues) 
...Alright! Alright! Alright! 
Hey, listen! Listen! Listen, man! listen, man! 
I don't know how many you people believe in astrology... 
Yeah, that's right...that's right, baby, I...I am a 
Sagittarius 
The most philosophical of all the signs 
But anyway, I don't believe in it 
I think it's a bunch of bullshit, myself 
But I tell you this, man, I tell you this 
I don't know what's gonna happen, man, but I wanna have 
my kicks before the whole shithouse goes up in flames 
Alright! "
7,An American Prayer ,"Do you know the warm progress
under the stars?
Do you know we exist?
Have you forgotten the keys
to the kingdom
Have you been borne yet
& are you alive?
Let's reinvent the gods, all teh myths
of the ages
Celebrate symbols from deep elder forests
[Have you forgotten the lessons
of the ancient war]
We need great golden copulations
The fathers are cackling in trees
of the forest
Our mother is dead in the sea
Do you know we are being led to
slaughters by placid admirals
& that fat slow generals are getting
obscene on young blood
Do you know we are ruled by T.V.
The moon is dry blood beast
Guerrilla bands are rolling numbers
in the next block of green vine
amassing for warfare on innocent
herdsman who are just dying
O great creator of being
grant us one more hour to
perform our art
The moths & atheists are doubly divine
& dying
We live, we die
& death not ends it
& perfect our lives
Journey we more into the
Nightmare
Cling to life
Our passion'd flower
Cling to Cunts & cocks
of despair
We got our final vision
by clap
Columbus groin got
filled w/green death
(I touched her thigh
& death smiled)
We have assembled inside this ancient
& insane theatre
To propagate our lust for life
& flee the swarming wisdom
of the streets
The barns are stormed
The windows kept
& only one of all the rest
To dance & save us
W/the divine mockery
of words
Music inflames temperament
(When the true King's murderers
are allowed to roam free
a 1000 Magicians arise in the land)
Where are the feasts
we are promised
Where is the wine
The New Wine
(dying on the vine)
resident mockery
give us an hour for magic
We of the purple glove
We of the starling flight
& velvet hour
We of arabic pleasures's breed
We of sundome & the night
Give us a creed
To believe
A nightr of lust
Give us trust in
The Night
Give of color
hundred hues
a rich mandala
for me & for you
& for your silky
pillowed house
a head, wisdom
& a bed
Troubled decree
Resident mockery
has claimed thee
We used to believe
in the good old days
We still receive
In little ways
The things of Kindness
& unsporting brow
Forget & allow
Did you know freedom exists
in school books
Did you know madmen are
running our prisons
w/in a jail, w/in a gaol
w/in a white free protestant
maelstrom
We're perched headlong
on the edge of boredom
We're reaching for death
on the end of a candle
We're trying for something
that's already found us
Wow, I'm sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain
south
Cruel bindings
The sevants have the power
dog-men & their mean women
pulling poor blankets over
our sailors
I'm sick of dour faces
Starong at me from the T.V.
Tower, I want roses in
my garden bower; dig?
Royal babies, rubies
must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal
for the plant that's plowed
they are waiting to take us into
the severed garden
Do you know how pale & wanton thrillful
comes death on a stranger hour
unannounced, unplanned for
like a scaring over-friendly guest you've
brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
& gives us wings
where we had shoulders
smooth as raven's
claws
No more money, no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
until its other jaw reveals incest
& loose obedience to a vegetable law
I will not go
Prefer a feast of friends
To the Giant family"
8,Angels and sailors ,"Angels and sailors 
rich girls 
backyard fences 
tents 

Dreams watching each other narrowly 
soft luxuriant cars 
Girls in garages, stripped 
out to get liquor and clothes 
half gallons of wine and six-packs of beer 
Jumped, humped, born to suffer 
made to undress in the wilderness. 

I will never treat you mean 
Never start no kind of scene 
I'll tell you every place and person that I've been. 

Always a playground instructor, never a killer 
Always a bridesmaid on the verge of fame or over 
He maneuvered two girls into his hotel room 
One a friend, the other, the young one, a newer stranger 
Vaguely Mexican or Puerto Rican 
Poor boys thighs and buttock scarred by a father's belt 
She's trying to rise 
Story of her boyfriend, of teenage stoned death games 
Handsome lad, dead in a car 
Confusion 
No connections 
Come 'ere 
I love you 
Peace on earth 
Will you die for me? 
Eat me 
This way 
The end 

I'll always be true 
Never go out, sneaking out on you, babe 
If you'll only show me Far Arden again. 

I'm surprised you could get it up 
He whips her lightly, sardonically, with belt 
Haven't I been through enough? she asks 
Now dressed and leaving 
The Spanish girl begins to bleed 
She says her period 
It' sCatholic heaven 
I have an ancient Indian crucifix around my neck 
My chest is hard and brown 
Lying on stained, wretched sheets with a bleeding virgin 
We could plan a murder 
Or start a religion. "
9,Awake ,"Shake dreams from your hair 
My pretty child 
My sweet one 
Choose the day 
And choose the sign of your day 
The day's divinity 
First thing you see 

A vast radiant beach 
In a cool jeweled moon 
Couples naked race down by it's quiet side 
And we laugh like soft, mad children 
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy 
The music and voices are all around us 
Choose they croon the ancient ones 
Beneath the moon 
Beside an ancient lake 
Enter again the sweet forest 
Enter the hot dream 
Come with us 
Everything is broken up and dances "
10,Awake Ghost Song ,"Awake

Shake dreams from your hair
My pretty child, my sweet one.
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day
The day's divinity
First thing you see

A vast radiant beach in a cool jeweled moon
Couples naked race down by it's quiet side
And we laugh like soft, mad children
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy

The music and voices are all around us

Choose they croon the Ancient Ones
The time has come again
Choose now, they croon
Beneath the moon
Beside an ancient lake
Enter again the sweet forest
Enter the hot dream, come with us
Everything is broken up and dances.

Indians scattered, 
On dawn's highway bleeding 
Ghosts crowd the young child's, 
Fragile eggshell mind 

We have assembled inside, 
This ancient and insane theater 
To propagate our lust for life, 
And flee the swarming wisdom of the streets. 

The barns have stormed 
The windows kept, 
And only one of all the rest 
To dance and save us 
From the divine mockery of words, 
Music inflames temperament. 

Oh great creator of being 
Grant us one more hour, 
To perform our art 
And perfect our lives. 

We need great golden copulations, 

When the true kings murderers 
Are allowed to roam free, 
A thousand magicians arise in the land 
Where are the feast we are promised?"

17,Black polished chrome ,"The music was new 
black polished chrome 
And came over the summer 
like liquid night. 
The DJ's took pills to stay awake 
and play for seven days 
They went to the studio 
And someone knew him 
Someone knew the TV showman 
He came to our homeroom party 
and played records 
And when he left in the hot noon sun 
and walked to his car 
We saw the chooks had written 
F-U-C-K on his windshield 
He wiped it off with a rag 
and smiling coolly drove away 
He's rich. Got a big car. 

My gang will get you 
Scenes of rape in the arroyo 
Seduction in cars, abandoned buildings 
Fights at the food stand 
The dust 
the shoes 
Open shirts and raised collars 
Bright sculptured hair. 

Hey man, you want girls, pills, grass? C'mon... 
I show you good time. 
This place has everything. C'mon... 
I show you. "

Night divides the day

Tried to hide 

Break on through to the other side

We chased our pleasures here 
Dug our treasures there

The time we cried 

Break on through to the other side 
Break on through to the other side 

Everybody loves my baby 
Everybody loves my baby 
She get high

27,"Curses, Invocation ","Curses, Invocations
Weird bate-headed mongrels
I keep expecting one of you to rise
Large buxom obese queen
Garden hogs and cunt veterans
Quaint cabbage saints
Shit hoarders and individualists
Drag strip officials
Tight lipped losers and
Lustful fuck salesman
My militant dandies
All strange orders of monsters
Hot on the tail of the woodvine
We welcome you to our procession
Here come the Comedians
look at them smile
Watch them dance an Indian mile
Look at them gesture
How aplomb
So to gesture everyone
Words dissemble
Words be quick
Words resemble walking sticks
Plant them they will grow
Watch them waver so
I'll always be a word man
Better then a bird man"
28,Dawn's Highway ,"Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind.
Me and my -ah- mother and father - and a
grandmother and a grandfather - were driving through
the desert, at dawn, and a truck load of Indian
workers had either hit another car, or just - I don't
know what happened - but there were Indians scattered
all over the highway, bleeding to death.
So the car pulls up and stops. That was the first time
I tasted fear. I musta' been about four - like a child is
like a flower, his head is just floating in the
breeze, man.
The reaction I get now thinking about it, looking
back - is that the souls of the ghosts of those dead
Indians...maybe one or two of 'em...were just
running around freaking out, and just leaped into my
soul. And they're still in there.
Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind.
Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of Phantastic L.A.
Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born in the birth if a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union
Blood on the rise, it's following me.
Indian, Indian what did you die for?
Indian says, nothing at all."
29,"Dead Cats, Dead Rats ","Dead cats, dead rats, did you see what they were at, alright
Dead cat in a top hat
Sucking on a young man's blood
Wishing he could come, yeah
Sucking on the soldier's brain
Wishing it would be the same
Dead cat, dead rat, did you see what they were at
Fat cat in a top hat
Thinks he's an aristocrat Thinks he can kill and slaughter
Thinks he can shoot my daughter
Dead cats, dead rats, think you're an aristocrat
Crap...ha, that's crap"

41,Ghost Song ,"Shake dreams for your hair
My pretty child, my sweet one.
Choose the day
And choose the sign of your day,
The day's divinity.
First thing you see.

A vast radiant beach
And a cool jeweled moon.
Couples naked race down
By its quiet side,
And we laugh like
Soft mad children
Smug in the wooly
Cotton brains of infancy.

The music and voices
Are all around us.

Choose they croon
The ancient ones,
The time has come again.
Choose now they croon
Beneath the moon
Beside an ancient lake.
Enter again the sweet forest.
Enter the hot dream
Come with us.
Everything is broken up
And dances.

Indians scattered on
Dawn's highway bleeding,
Ghosts crowd the young child's
Fragile egg-shell mind."

45,Graveyard poem ,"It was the greatest night of my life. 
Although I still had not found a wife 
I had my friends 
Right there beside me. 
We were close together. 
We tripped the wall and we scaled the graveyard 
Ancient shapes were all around us. 
The wet dew felt fresh beside the fog. 
Two made love in an ancient spot 
One chased a rabbit into the dark 
A girl got drunk and balled the dead 
And I gave empty sermons to my head. 
Cemetary, cool and quiet 
Hate to leave your sacred lay 
Dread the milky coming of the day. "
46,Hang On To Your Life ,"Sweet bird of prey you've gone below
All soft and black it's time to grow
Don't be afraid to touch the light
Don't run from love in the starless night

Hang on to your life it's begun now
Hang on paradise here we come now
Life is like the wind, where does it begin?

Time come again, where's your day now?
Bring me your sunlight, it's the way now
Just spread your wings and taste the sky
It's time to laugh, it's time to fly
The mountain air is clear and bright
Your shadow world is endless night

Hang on to your life it's begun now
Hang on paradise here we come now

Hang on to your life it's begun now
Hang on paradise here we come now
Life is like the wind, where's it gonna end?"

I found a new place to dwell.
It's down at the end of lonely street,

Like a statue in the sky
Her arms are wicked and her legs are long

Sidewalk crouches at her feet
Like a dog that begs for something sweet
Do you hope to make her see you, fool?
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

And her sullen and aborted 
Currents breed tiny monsters 
True sailing is dead 

Awkward instant 
And the first animal is jettisoned 
Legs furiously pumping 
Their stiff green gallop 

And heads bob up 
Poise
Delicate
Pause
Consent 

In mute nostril agony 
Carefully refined 
And sealed over"

No such thing as you and or meNo time,
pure mind
In the eye of the sun,
before the world had begun
It had been a lot of work the last time around
I needed a rest,
a chance to just lie downAlways on the go,
no time to kill
a lot of runnin' to and fro,
hard workin' at the mill
So it blew up,
and I flew upinto the eye of the sun
before the world had begun
Well I hung around,
I don't know how many yearsNo more troubles,
no more fears
Had a lot of rest with-a nothing to do
I wanted flesh and blood and skin and bonesa
multi-dimensional universal home
I wanted space and time,
up and downlife and death,
and love all around
I knew there'd be trouble,
but I could pull through
so,
I thought up the world and you did too"

It just done slipped my mind
It's just so hard to find
It just done slipped my mind
I left my body somewhere down the line
It's just so easy to lose track of time
It just done slipped my mind
It just done slipped my mind
It wouldn't matter, but it's time to meditate.
You know, it just done slipped my mind
My memory's unrefined
They must have spiked my wine
Because it just done slipped my mind
My mind and body are still out of tune
I hope they run into each other real soon
It just done slipped my mind
It just done slipped my mind
I wouldn't mind, but it's cold here on the moon
It just done slipped my mind.
You now, it just done slipped my mind
My memory's unrefined

To speak to the heart
And give the great gift

Wild haired chicks
Women flowering in their summit
Monsters of skin
Each color connects
to create the boat
which rocks the race
Could any hell be more horrible
than now
and real?
I pressed her thigh and death smiled
death, old friend
death and my cock are the world
I can forgive my injuries in the name of
Wisdom Luxury Romance
Sentence upon sentence
Words are the healing lament
For the death of my cock's spirit
Has no meaning in the soft fire
Words got me the wound and will get me well
I you believe it
All join now and lament the death of my cock
A tounge of knowledge in the feathered night
Boys get crazy in the head and suffer
I sacrifice my cock on the alter of silence"

Got to find my shipmates 
And walk on foreign sands.""

With silver in his smile. 
He smoked a briar pipe and 
He walked four country miles. 
Singing song of shady sisters 
And old time liberty, 
Songs of love and songs of death, 
And songs to set me free.

A course for ports unread. 
I'll stand at mast, let north winds blow 
Till half of us are dead.

Gonna buy a bottle and drink my fill.

Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of Phantastic L.A.

Poor Otis dead and gone 

Back down, turnen around slowly 
Try it again 
Remembering when

Much too easy remembering when

Don`t fight - too much to lose 
Can`t fight the running blue 

Well, I`ve got the running blues 
Running away 
Back to L.A. 
Got to find the dock on the bay 
Maybe find it back in L.A. 

Running scared, running blue 
Going so fast, what`ll I do? 

Well, I`ve got the running blues 
Running away

Out on the train yard 
Nursin' penitentiary 
It's gone 
I cry out long 

Go head 
Brother 

Did you stop it to consider? 
How it will feel 
Cold, grinded grizzly bear jaws 
Hot on your heels 

Do you often stop and whisper? 
It's Saturday's shore 
The whole world's a savior 
Who could ever 
Ever 
Ever 
Ever 
Ever 
Ever 
Ask for more? 

Do you remember? 
Will you stop? 
Will you stop?

And there will never be

While you run the field 
I'm alone for you 
And I cry

When she wakes up
Come on, now right

You think that you're so though
Well you got some thing momma,
But it's not enough

Why do ships with sails love the wind?
And will I be thinking of you
will I ever pass this way again?
I'll be returning some day
Until then
please don't ask me my direction
Let my tracks be buried in the sea
Cause to wander's my infection
till the four winds bring you back to me
Don't count your memories
think of me as just a dream
Just like this melody I sing"
105,Someday soon ,"Someday soon 
Someday soon 
Familiar freaks will fill your living room 
Rugs lash out their lizard tongues 
You're not getting young 
You're not getting young 

But you're going to die 
And you're going to be needing all of your eyes 

You’ll be all alone 
When the animals cry 
All by yourself 
In some infancy’s lie 

Someday soon 
Someday soon 
Television bleeding like a harvest moon 
Flush the scissors down the hole 
You're getting old 
You're getting old 

And I hate to remind you but your going to die 
And you're going to be needing all of your lies 

You’ll be all alone 
When the animals cry 
All by yourself 
In some infancy's lie

Still one place to go 
Still one place to go 

Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen 
Warm my mind near your gentle stove 
Turn me out and I'll wander baby 
Stumblin' in the neon groves 

Well, your fingers weave quick minarets 
Speak in secret alphabets 
I light another cigarette 
Learn to forget, learn to forget 
Learn to forget, learn to forget 

Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen 
Warm my mind near your gentle stove 
Turn me out and I'll wander baby

No eternal reward will forgive us now 
For wasting the dawn. 

Back in those days everything was simpler and more confused 
One summer night, going to the pier 
I ran into two young girls 
The blonde one was called Freedom 
The dark one, Enterprise 
We talked and they told me this story 
Now listen to this... 
I'll tell you about Texas radio and the big beat 
Soft driven, slow and mad 
Like some new language 
Reaching your head with the cold, sudden fury of a divine messenger 
Let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god 
Wandering, wandering in hopeless night 
Out here in the perimeter there are no stars 

Out here we is stoned 
Immaculate. "

Strange days have tracked us down
They're goin' to destroy 
Our casual joys
We shall go on playing or find a new town

Strange eyes fill strange rooms
Voices will signal their tired end
The hostess is grinning
Her guests sleep from sinning
Hear me talk of sin and you know this is it
Yeah

Strange days have found us
And through their strange hours, we linger alone
Bodies confused
Memories misused
As we run from the day to a strange night of stone"

116,The celebration of the lizard ,"Lions in the street and roaming 
Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming 
A beast caged in the heart of a city 
The body of his mother 
Rotting in the summer ground 
He fled the town 

He went down South and crossed the border 
Left the chaos and disorder 
Back there over his shoulder 

One morning he awoke in a green hotel 
With a strange creature groaning beside him 
Sweat oozed from its shiny skin 

Is everybody in? 
The ceremony is about to begin 

Wake up! 
You can't remember where it was 
Had this dream stopped? 
The snake was pale gold 
Glazed and shrunken 
We were afraid to touch it 
The sheets were hot dead prisons 

Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom 
Look! 
I can't live thru each slow century of her moving 
I let my cheek slide down 
The cool smooth tile 
Feel the good cold stinging blood 
The smooth hissing snakes of rain . . . 

Once I had, a little game 
I liked to crawl back into my brain 
I think you know the game I mean 
I mean the game called 'go insane' 
Now you should try this little game 
Just close your eyes forget your name 
Forget the world forget the people 
And we'll erect a different steeple 
This little game is fun to do 
Just close your eyes no way to lose 
And I'm right there I'm going too 
Release control we're breaking thru 

Way back deep into the brain 
Back where there's never any pain 
And the rain falls gently on the town 
And in the labyrinth of streams 
Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of 
Nervous hill dwellers in the gentle hills around 
Reptiles abounding 
Fossils, caves, cool air heights 

Each house repeats a mold 
Windows rolled 
Beast car locked in against morning 
All now sleeping 
Rugs silent, mirrors vacant 
Dust blind under the beds of lawful couples 
Wound in sheets 
And daughters, smug 
With semen eyes in their nipples 

Wait 
There's been a slaughter here 

(Don't stop to speak or look around 
Your gloves and fan are on the ground 
We're getting out of town 
We're going on the run 
And you're the one I want to come 

Not to touch the earth 
Not to see the sun 
Nothing left to do, but 
Run, run, run 
Let's run 
House upon the hill 
Moon is lying still 
Shadows of the trees 
Witnessing the wild breeze 
C'mon baby run with me 
Let's run 
Run with me 
Run with me 
Run with me 
Let's run 

The mansion is warm, at the top of the hill 
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there 
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs 
And you won't know a thing till you get inside 
Dead president's corpse in the driver's car 
The engine runs on glue and tar 
C'mon along, we're not going very far 
To the East to meet the Czar 

Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake 
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake 
Who lives in a well by the side of the road 
Wake up, girl! We're almost home 
Sun, sun, sun 
Burn, burn, burn 
Soon, soon, soon 
Moon, moon, moon 
I will get you 
Soon!, Soon!, Soon! 

Let the carnival bells ring 
Let the serpent sing 
Let everything 

We came down 
The rivers and highways 
We came down from 
Forests and falls 

We came down from 
Carson and Springfield 
We came down from 
Phoenix enthralled 
And I can tell you 
The names of the Kingdom 
I can tell you 
The things that you know 
Listening for a fistful of silence 
Climbing valleys into the shade 

I am the Lizard King 
I can do anything 
I can make the earth stop in its tracks 
I made the blue cars go away 

For seven years I dwelt 
In the loose palace of exile 
Playing strange games 
With the girls of the island 
Now I have come again 
To the land of the fair, and the strong, and the wise 
Brothers and sisters of the pale forest 
O Children of Night 
Who among you will run with the hunt? 
Now Night arrives with her purple legion 
Retire now to your tents and to your dreams 
Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth 
I want to be ready'"

118,The Crystal Ship ,"Before you slip into unconsciousness
I'd like to have another kiss
Another flashing chance at bliss
Another kiss, another kiss

The days are bright and filled with pain
Enclose me in your gentle rain
The time you ran was too insane
We'll meet again, we'll meet again

Oh tell me where your freedom lies
The streets are fields that never die
Deliver me from reasons why
You'd rather cry, I'd rather fly

The crystal ship is being filled
A thousand girls, a thousand thrills
A million ways to spend your time
When we get back, Ill drop a line"
119,The End ,"This is the end
Beautiful friend
This is the end
My only friend, the end

Of our elaborate plans, the end
Of everything that stands, the end
No safety or surprise, the end
I'll never look into your eyes...again

Can you picture what will be
So limitless and free
Desperately in need...of some...stranger's hand
In a...desperate land

Lost in a Roman...wilderness of pain
And all the children are insane
All the children are insane
Waiting for the summer rain, yeah

There's danger on the edge of town
Ride the King's highway, baby
Weird scenes inside the gold mine
Ride the highway west, baby

Ride the snake, ride the snake
To the lake, the ancient lake, baby
The snake is long, seven miles
Ride the snake...he's old, and his skin is cold

The west is the best
The west is the best
Get here, and we'll do the rest

The blue bus is callin' us
The blue bus is callin' us
Driver, where you taken' us

The killer awoke before dawn, he put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived, and...then he
Paid a visit to his brother, and then he
He walked on down the hall, and
And he came to a door...and he looked inside
„Father?” „Yes son?” „I want to kill you.”
„Mother? I want to...”

C'mon baby, take a chance with us
C'mon baby, take a chance with us
C'mon baby, take a chance with us

The end of laughter and soft lies
The end of nights we tried to die

This is the end"
120,The hill dweller ,"Way back deep into the brain 
Way back past the realm of pain 
Back where there`s never any rain 

And the rain falls gently on the town 
And over the heads of all of us 

And in the labyrinth of streams beneath the 
Quiet unearthly presence of 
Nervous hill dwellers in the gently hills around 
Reptiles abounding 
Fossils, caves, cool air heights "
121,The hitchhiker ,"Thoughts in time and out of season 
The Hitchhiker 
Stood by the side of the road 
And leveled his thumb 
In the calm calculus of reason 
Hi. How you doin'? I just got back into town L.A. 
I was out on the desert for awhile 
Riders on the storm 
Yeah. In the middle of it 
Riders on the storm 
Right... 
Into this world we're born 
Hey, listen, man, I really got a problem 
Into this world we're thrown 
When I was out on the desert, ya know 
Like a dog without a bone 
An actor out on loan 
I don't know how to tell you 
Riders on the storm 
but, ah, I killed somebody 
There's a killer on the road 
No... 
His brain is squirming like a toad 
It's no big deal, ya know 
I don't think anybody will find out about it, but... 
take a long holiday 
just, ah... 
Let your children play 
this guy gave me a ride, and ah... 
If you give this man a ride 
started giving me a lot of trouble 
Sweet family will die 
and I just couldn't take it, ya know 
Killer on the road 
And I wasted him 
Yeah "
122,The Mosquito ,"No me moleste mosquito
No me moleste mosquito
No me moleste mosquito
Why don't you go home
No me moleste mosquito

No me moleste mosquito

No me moleste mosquito
No me moleste mosquito

Just Let me eat my burrito
No me moleste mosquito

123,The movie ,"The movie will begin in five moments 
The mindless voice announced 
All those unseated will await the next show. 

We filed slowly, languidly into the hall 
The auditorium was vast and silent 
As we seated and were darkened, the voice continued. 

The program for this evening is not new 
You've seen this entertainment through and through 
You've seen your birth your life and death 
you might recall all of the rest 
Did you have a good world when you died? 
Enough to base a movie on?. 


I'm getting out of here 
Where are you going? 
To the other side of morning 
Please don't chase the clouds, pagodas 

Her cunt gripped him like a warm, friendly hand. 

It's alright, all your friends are here 
When can I meet them? 
After you've eaten 
I'm not hungry 
Uh, we meant beaten 

Silver stream, silvery scream 
Oooooh, impossible concentration. "
124,The palace of exile ,"For seven years I dwelt in the loose palace of exile 
Playing strange games with the girls of the island

125,The Peking King And The New York Queen ,"Well, I heard a story you can judge it's worth
About the sun and the moon
This time they came down to earth
They passed in the heavens each day up above
Time after time and it soon became love
They could not touch, they could not kiss
They had no flesh, no earthly bliss
So they made a scheme, they made a plan
They would come down to earth as a woman and a man
She rode a lunar wave, he flew a solar beam
They took on human forms to live out a dream
The most beautiful people that I've ever seen
They were the Peking King and the New York Queen
I said the Peking King and the New York Queen.
As fate would have it in the toss of the dice
They went to opposite ends of this world of our lives
Opposite eyes, opposite minds
Such things matter in these troubled times.
Peking in the East and New York in the West
Each place thought that it was the best
But the sun and the moon on their earthly quest
Knew without a doubt that it was all the best
They said what does it matter how you read a book
It's all the same no matter how it looks.
Well the only thing important to the Peking King
Was bein' in the arms of his New York Queen
Thousand of miles, they were so far apart
How to get together? Oh, where to start?
On the California Zephyr and the Shanghai Express
He headed to Hong Kong, she headed out west.
No passports, no visas, no government quotas
No secret missile sites in South Dakota
No red tape, no red guard could stop the dream
Of the Peking King and the New York Queen
I said, the Peking King and the New York Queen
Well they found a little island in the Philippines
It was a perfect little place to live out a dream
They say East is East, West is West
They say the twain won't meet, but don't you take that bet
'Cause you're invited to a wedding and to share the dream
Of the Peking King and the New York Queen
The Peking King and the New York Queen."
126,The Piano Bird ,"A bird sings outside my piano
Lark of sweet love singing low
The more I play, the more he sings
He lives right up there in the green trees
Singing to me melodies
And in return I play for him
I played him a song on my piano
Well I played real good
And I played what I could
And in return, he sang for me
He lives right out there in the tree
Giving me his melodies
A bird sings outside my piano
Well I played real good
And I played what I could
And in return, he sang for me
He lives right out there in the tree
Giving me his melodies
A bird sings outside my piano
A bird sings outside my piano
Lark of sweet love singing low
He lives right up there in the green tree
Singing to me melodies
The more I play, the more he sings
A bird sings outside my piano."
127,The Severed Garden ,"Wow, I’m sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain
Souths Cruel bindings.
The servants have the power
Dog-men and their mean women
Pulling poor blankets over
Our sailors

I’m sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the tv
Tower
I want roses in
My garden bower, dig?
Royal babies, rubies
Must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal
For the plant that’s plowed.

They are waiting to take us into
The severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful
Comes death on a strange hour
Unannounced, unplanned for
Like a scaring over-friendly guest you’ve
Brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
And gives us wings
Where we had shoulders
Smooth as raven’s
Claws

No more money, no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
Until it’s other jaw reveals incest
And loose obedience to a vegetable law.

I will not go
Prefer a feast of friends
To the giant family."
128,The soft parade ,"When I was back there in seminary school, 
There was a person there
Who put forth the proposition, 
That you can petition the lord with prayer
Petition the lord with prayer, 
Petition the lord with prayer
You cannot petition the lord with prayer!

Can you give me sanctuary
I must find a place to hide, 
A place for me to hide
Can you find me soft asylum, 
I cant make it anymore, 
The man is at the door

Peppermint, miniskirts, chocolate candy, champion Sax and a girl named sandy
Theres only four ways to get unraveled, 
One is to sleep and the other is travel, da da
One is a bandit up in the hills, 
One is to love your neighbor till
His wife gets home

Catacombs, nursery bones, winter women, growing stones
Carrying babies, to the river
Streets and shoes, avenues, leather riders
Selling news, the monk bought lunch
Ha ha, he bought a little, yes, he did, woo!
This is the best part of the trip, this is the trip, the best part
I really like, whatd he say? 
Pretty good, Im proud to be a part of this number
Successful hills are here to stay
Everything must be this way
Gentle streets where people play
Welcome to the soft parade
All our lives we sweat and save 
Building for a shallow grave
Must be something else we say
Somehow to defend this place
Everything must be this way
Everything must be this way
The soft parade has now begun
Listen to the engines hum
People out to have some fun
A cobra on my left
Leopard on my right
The deer woman in a silk dress
Girls with beads around their necks
Kiss the hunter of the green vest
Who has wrestled before
With lions in the night
Out of sight!, the lights are getting brighter
The radio is moaning, calling to the dogs
There are still a few animals, left out in the yard
But its getting harder, to describe sailors, to the underfed
Tropic corridor, tropic treasure
What got us this far, to this mild equator? 
We need someone or something new
Something else to get us through, yeah, cmon
Callin on the dogs, callin on the dogs
Oh, its gettin harder, callin on the dogs
Callin in the dogs, callin all the dogs, callin on the gods
You gotta meet me, too late, baby
Slay a few animals, at the crossroads, too late
All in the yard, but its gettin harder, by the crossroads
You gotta meet me, oh, were goin, were goin great
At the edge of town, tropic corridor, tropic treasure
Havin a good time, got to come along, what got us this far
To this mild equator? , outskirts of the city, you and i
We need someone new, somethin new, somethin else to get us through
Better bring your gun, better bring your gun
Tropic corridor, tropic treasure, were gonna ride and have some fun

When all else fails, we can whip the horses eyes
And make them sleep, and cry"

130,The Unknown Soldier ,"Wait until the war is over
And we're both a little older

The unknown soldier

Breakfast where the news is read
Television children fed
Unborn, living
Living, dead
Bullet strikes the helmets head

And it's all over for the unknown soldier
It's all over for the unknown soldier

""Company, halt!""

""Present arms!""

Make a grave for the unknown soldier
Nestled in your hollow shoulder

The unknown soldier

Breakfast where the news is read
Television children fed
Bullet strikes the helmets head

It's all over
The war is over
It's all over
The war is over..."
131,The Wasp (Texas Radio And The Big Beat) ,"I wanna tell you 'bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Comes out of the Virginia swamps
Cool and slow with plenty of precision
With a back beat narrow and hard to master
Some call it heavenly in it's brilliance
Others, mean and ruthful of the Western dream
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft
We have constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping
This is the land where the Pharaoh died
The Negroes in the forest brightly feathered
They are saying, ""Forget the night.
Live with us in forests of azure.
Out here on the perimeter there are no stars
Out here we is stoned - immaculate.""
Listen to this, and I'll tell you 'bout the heartache
I'll tell you 'bout the heartache and the lose of God
I'll tell you 'bout the hopeless night
The meager food for souls forgot
I'll tell you 'bout the maiden with raw iron soul
I'll tell you this
No eternal reward will forgive us now for wasting the dawn
I'll tell you 'bout Texas Radio and the Big Beat
Soft drivin', slow and mad, like some new language
Now, listen to this, and I'll tell you 'bout the Texas
I'll tell you 'bout the Texas Radio
I'll tell you 'bout the hopeless night
Wandering the Western dream
Tell you 'bout the maiden with raw iron soul"
132,The World On Fire ,"The World on Fire...Taxi from Africa...The Grand Hotel...
He was drunk a big party last night back going back
in all directions sleeping these insane hours I'll never wake up
in a good mood again I'm sick of these stinky boots"
133,There You Sit ,"There you sit
All by yourself.
Everybody's dancing,
Cannot help themselves.

Come on girl,
Get that groove.
You know baby,
Like to see you move, child.
"
134,Tightrope Ride ,"You're on a tightrope ride, nobody by your side
Well, you're all alone, gotta find a new home

Don't go over the line. You better keep on time
Or you'll lose your mind on your tightrope ride

Watch out, don't fall! Careful, don't slip!

You better get your balance, you have to feel the way
There are no more questions, no answers today

There are no reasons, there are no more rhymes
But if you feel it, you can fly next time
You can fly next time, or maybe this time

Did you think we were all together?
Did you think we were all the same?
Did you think maybe I could help you
Remember your name, remember the game
What's the name of the game

It's a very good game, never stays the same
It's the number one from mud to sun

You're on a tightrope ride, we're all by your side
But you're all alone, and we're going home
And we're by your side, but you're all alone
Like a Rolling Stone, like Brian Jones
On a tightrope ride"
135,To Come Of Age ,"A military station in the desert.
Can we resolve the past
Lurking jaws, joints of time?
The Base
To come of age in a dry place
Holes and caves.
My friend drove and hour each day from the mountains
The bus gives you a hard-on with books in your lap
Someone shot the bird in the afternoon dance show
They gave out free records to the best couple
Spades dance best, from the hip."
136,Touch Me ,"Yeah! Come on, come on, come on, come on
Now touch me, baby
Can't you see that I am not afraid?

Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I

137,Tree Trunk ,"You and me caught in the heart of a rainstorm
Gettin' all wet, but I got me a brainstorm
Why don't we hide in the trunk of this tree for a while?
And we're gettin' so close
It's so warm that you're makin' me smile
Well, you're makin' me wish we could stay here
For more than a while.
Well, the rain has been over for two or three hours
We're gonna stay with the trees and the flowers
Why don't we stay here 'til nineteen seventy-four?
And I look at the sky
And I wish it would rain some more
And you're makin' me feel just like I've
Never felt before
This memory I can't erase
The raindrops on your face look so inviting
I know this love I can't resist
The way you pout your lips is so exciting
Inviting.
You and me caught in the heart of a rainstorm
Gettin' all wet, but I got me a brainstorm

138,Twentieth Century Fox ,"Well, she's fashionably lean 
And she's fashionably late 
She'll never rank a scene 
She'll never break a date 
But she's no drag 
Just watch the way she walks 

She's a twentieth century fox 
She's a twentieth century fox 

No tears, no fears 
No ruined years, no clocks 
She's a twentieth century fox, oh yeah 

She's the queen of cool 
And she's the lady who waits 
Since her mind left school 
It never hesitates 
She won't waste time 
On elementary talk 

'Cause she's a twentieth century fox

Got the world locked up 
Inside a plastic box

145,Wake Up ,"Wake up !
You can't remember where it was
Had this dream stopped?
The snake was pale gold, glazed and shrunken
We were afraid to touch it
The sheets were hot dead prisons
And she was beside me, old she's known, young
Her dark hair, the white soft skin
Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom
Look ! She's coming in here
I can 't live through each slow century of her moving
I let my cheek slide down the cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain"

Dance on fire as it intends

Until the end
Until the end
Until the end

Cancel my subscription to the resurrection
Send my credentials to the house of detention
I got some friends inside

The face in the mirror won't stop
The girl in the window won't drop
A feast of friends ""Alive"" she cried
Waitin' for me outside

Before I sink into the big sleep
I want to hear
I want to hear
The scream of the butterfly

Come back, baby
Back into my arm

We're gettin' tired of hangin' around
Waitin' around with our heads to the ground

I hear a very gentle sound
Very near, yet, very far
Very soft, yet, very clear
Come today, come today

What have they done to the earth?
What have they done to our fair sister?
Ravaged and plundered and ripped her and bit her
Stuck her with knives in the side of the dawn and
Tied her with fences and dragged her down

I hear a very gentle sound
With your ear down to the ground
We want the world and we want it
We want the world and we want it
Now
Now?
Now

Persian night, babe
See the light, babe
Save us, Jesus
Save us

So when the music's over
When the music's over, yeah
When the music's over
Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights
Turn out the lights

Well the music is your special friend
Dance on fire as it intends
Music is your only friend
Until the end
Until the end
Until the end"

150,"Whiskey, mystics and men ","Well, I’ll tell you a story
of whiskey and mystics and men,
And about the believers and
how the whole thing began.
First there were women and
children obeying the moon,
Then daylight brought wisdom
and fever and sickness too soon.
You can try to remind me
instead of the other, you can.
You can help to insure
that we all insecure our command.
If you don’t give a listen,
I won’t try to tell your new hand.
This is it; can’t you see
that we all have our ends in the band.

And if all of the teachers and
preachers of wealth were arraigned,
We could see quite a future
for me in the literal sands.
And if all the people
could claime to inspect such regrets,
well, we’d have no forgiveness,
forgetfullness, faithful remorse.
So I tell you, I tell you,
I tell you we must send away.
We must try to find a
new answer instead of a way."
151,Who Do You Love ,"I walked 47 miles on barbed-wire,
Got a cobra-snake for a necktie.
I built a house by the roadside,
Made of rattlesnake hide.
Got a brand new chimney up on top,
Made out of human skulls.
Come on baby take a walk with me,
And tell me who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Tombstone head and a graveyard mind,
I'm just 22 and I don't mind dying.
Rode around the town with a rattlesnake whip,
Come on baby don't give me no lip.
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
The night is dark, the sky was blue,
Down the alley the ice wagon flew.
Hit a bump, somebody screamed,
You should'a heard just what I seen.
Who, baby, who do you love?
What do you love, now?
Love, love, love me girl.
Love, love, love me darling."
152,Who Scared You ,"Who scared you
Why were you born, my babe.

In two-time's arms
With all of your charms, my love.

Why were you born
Just to play with me,
To freak out
Or to be beautiful, my dear?

Load your head,
Blow it up.
Feeling good, baby.

Load your head,
blow it up.
Feeling good, baby.
Ah.

Well my room is so cold,
You know you don't have to go, my babe.
And if you want it up right,
I'm gonna love you tonight, my love.

Well I'm glad that we came,
I hope you're feeling the same.
Who scared you
And why were you born,
Please stay.

I see a rider
Coming down the road.
Got a virgin
Carrying a heavy load.
One sack of silver,
And one bag of gold."
153,Wild Child ,"Wild child full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cool face

Natural child, terrible child
Not your mother's or your father's child
Your our child, screamin' wild

An ancient lunatic reigns, in the trees of the night

With hunger at her heels
Freedom in her eyes
She dances on her knees
Pirate prince at her side
Starin' into a hollow idols eyes 

Wild child full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cool face

Do you remember when we were in Africa?"
