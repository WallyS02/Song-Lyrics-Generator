0,Ain't No Fun (Waiting Round to be a Millionaire) ,"The following is a true story
Only the names have been changed to protect the guilty

Well, I left my job in my home town and headed for the smoke 
Got a rock 'n' roll band and a fast right hand 
Gonna get to the top 
Nothings gonna stop us, no, nothing

So if you've got the money, we've got the sound 
You put it up, we'll put it down 
If you've got the dollar, we've got the song 
Just wanna boogie woogie all night long, yeah, boogie 

I got holes in my shoes, I got holes in my teeth
I got holes in my socks, I can't get no sleep
I'm trying to make a million

And I got patches on the patches on my old blue jeans
Well, they used to be blue
When they used to be new, when they used to be clean

But I've got a mumma who's a hummer just keeping me alive
While I'm in the band doing drinking with the boys
She's working 9 to 5
She knows her place that woman

Just you wait
One of these days see me driving round town
In my Rock 'n' Rolls Royce with the sun roof down
My bottle of booze, no summer time blues
Shouting out 'look at me' in my rock 'n' roll voice

No it ain't no fun, yeah, waiting round to be a millionaire
No it ain't no fun, waiting round to be a millionaire

Do you believe me?
It ain't no fun, no, waiting round to be a millionaire
It ain't no fun, I don't care what they say
Waiting round to be a millionaire

Drive a Rolls Royce car
No it ain't no fun and you know it
Waiting round to be a millionaire
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ain't no fun
Waiting round to be a millionaire

Got a million dollar scream
But it ain't no fun (ain't no fun), oh no
No it ain't no fun (ain't no fun), that's what I said
But it ain't no fun (ain't no fun) and I wanna be rich
No it ain't no fun (ain't no fun), ain't no fun digging this bitch

Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire, you better believe me
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
No, it ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
No, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun) no, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
I ain't having no fun (ain't no fun), no,  it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire, no no
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
No, it ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire

Hey Hello, Howard, how you doin'?
Next door neighbour
Oh yeah, get your fuckin' jumbo jet off my airport

(Ain't no fun, ain't no fun)
No it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
Hey, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
No, it ain't no fun (ain't no fun)
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire
No, it ain't no fun, no, it ain't no fun, ain't no fun
(Ain't no fun waiting round to be a millionaire) no, no, no

Standing there holding out your hand,
Better lock up all your doors,
She’s like a spinning dynamo,
You’re handing out the token prize,
Giving you a brand new ride,

Ooh there she goes, she goes,
And nobody knows where she goes,

Banging drums, working out all fast,
Heavy tune I can play it loud,
You know she’s blowing away all the others,
You’re never man enough take it on all night,
You better razzle dazzle on that stage,
Keep on rocking all through the night,

Ooh there she goes, she goes,
And nobody knows,
Where she goes she goes,

A heavy rocking tune is playing,
Playing as the night rolls on,
Sneaking off with the Romeo,
Where she goes, nobody knows

(Guitar Solo)

A heavy rocking tune is playing on a flat screen colour TV,
Sneaking over creepy crawly, never give it up to take it out through the night,

There she goes she goes, and nobody knows,

Where she goes she goes, and nobody knows,

Gonna sit in the back, in the passion row

Said to buy my rubber at the cigarette stand
Dyin' to get it off so I can get it in
Doin' my best to make a good connection

Alright momma, gotta listen to me

There was trouble brewing in my home town 
It was the seventh day, I was the seventh son 
And it scared the hell out of everyone

They said fast, I said slow 
They said yes, I said no 
I do the bad boy boogie

I've had me more dirty women than most men ever had 
All you women come along with me 
And I'll show you how good a bad boy can be 

I said right and they said left 
I said east and they said west 
I said up and they said down 
I do the bad boy boogie all over town 

I wanna tell you no story, tell you no lie 
I was born to love till the day I die 
I just line them up and I knock them down 
And they all came running when the word got round 
(Just keep a running)

They said straight, I said round 
They said lost, I said found 
I said free and they said bound

'Twas there that we parted in yon shady glen,
On the steep, steep side o' Ben Lomon',
Where in purple hue the Hieland hills we view,
An' the moon comin' out in the gloamin'.
O ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak the low road,
An' I'll be in Scotland afore ye;
But me and my true love will never meet again
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomon'.

Hot feet in the cool of the shade 
Street shuffle and a tough childhoods 
Examinations done no good 
Crow bars and a hot wired cars

A hard case who's up to no good 
Living like trash, a society rash 
Ready to break, and ready to dash 
A bad deal and a real rough ride

No rebellion, not today 
I get my kicks in my own way

Excuse me, have you seen it? It's about this big 
And have you got a plastic bag 'cause I'm gonna be sick

While time
Destiny, ah destiny, it's calling me
Destiny, a place for me
Ah, destiny
I want destiny

The businessman got rich 
And in every bar there was a super star 
With a seven year itch 
There were fifteen million fingers 
Learning how to play 
And you could hear the fingers picking 
And this is what they had to say

""Drums"" 
""Guitar""

106,Me ,"No more
I don't need a job and I don't need no friends
People bore me to the end I wish that I were dead
All this stench that fills the air reminds me of the dump
And when I turn on my tv, the fuckin' Brady Bunch
The cluelessness of middle class is what I'm living for
In San Jose there's too many dicks, it's a bore, a bore
My parents are getting stressed, just give my ears a rest
I wake in time to go to school to take another test
No more
It's such a total waste, don't worry about me I'll set my own pace.

It screamed aloud
Your dancing and your singing
Gave it a shroud
We all may have laughed
As they dragged us down
Now all the clear is mundane
With a broken, crooked crown

Sometimes
I don't feel your love
Sometimes
I can only hope to stay alive
Sometimes
You come and take me away

I feel like the chatter
Cleared my head
But always your ways
Left me better off for dead

The chance of reason shook
Away the way
Now all is a Sunday
For a man who's lost his way

Sometimes
I don't feel your love
Sometimes
I can only hope to stay alive
Sometimes
You come and take me away

Don't lean back too far
As the colors fade to gray
Don't breathe in too much
Or the weight will blow you away

Do you give a little in?
All that's left is sometimes right
Your happiness danced away
Far away...
To the distance in the twilight

Like the storm rules over the sea
I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone

Don`t dare me now
The threatening shadows will pass by
There`re getting closer now
Open your eyes
Wake up my dear young friend
And hate shall fade away

I will not move, yet
I`ll stand still, instead

There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he`s lost
And on the battlefield it ends

War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you`re driven insane
I`m lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won`t wane `til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It`s gone forevermore

The field`s been left in sorrow
The father and the son
They`re gone

The sun shines bright
And anger rises
Lorn and lonely
Torn apart
Don`t you think
It`s time to stop now
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent`s kiss

Let`s pray
That heaven is on our side
Through violence and horror
Shall honour arise

So let`s pray
And blessed shall be our leader
We follow the noble and bright

Don`t you hear me crying
Crying
Come take me away
I hallow thy name

There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he`s lost
And on the battlefield it ends

Paints surrealist scenes on the wall
So I tell her for fun, that it's really well done
But she just ain't listenin' at all

She points to my heart, tellin' me if I'm smart
I'll practice and phase
Out and admit, when the shoe doesn't fit
And I went screaming out down the hall

Really need it
Really need your love
Really need your love
Need your love need your love love love love love love love love love love

Just then I heard a poundin' on the door
We're all here, sang the voice of twenty more

She tied me up with my frustration and snapped my robber band
I remember a sweet patchouli she absolutely adored
Its all about with who your hanging & she gave me too much rope

Shes a queen of my deliusion
Shes my Zen from way back when
And because of my confusion 
Is a face without a name

She lived on lucky charms & coffee
And Cracker Jacks surprise
She had me all reborn 
And then she killed me with her eyes

Shes the queen of my deliusion
Shes my friend from way back when
And because of my confusion 
Is a face without a name

Try and get a little bit 
There's really nothing wrong with it 
If no one see's ya
What you gonna say 
When i dont know anyone 
Blame it on the damn amnesia
Forgotten love dont got away 
Shes still a name without a face

We did a little nip & tuck then 
She whispered to my brain
She said lets fuck then 
I forgot her name

Shes the queen of my deliusion
Shes my Zen from way back when
And because of my confusion 
Yeah i've come to that conclusion
And she comes to me at all

The night I met the pony 
It was so dark that I could hardly see 
It smelled so sweet you know who and Joanie 
So many butterflies one could not see 

We all could feel desire 
Took off in flight 
It was hotter than fire 
Then came the light 

Oooh, oooh 
Oooh, ah, now smell the heat 
The dancing pony unwrapped his wings 
To dry off Joanie 
The pony he grew in size 
In thunder and rain 
And finally realized 
A what he was and what he does 
And what he couldn't say

And left to kiss the cheek of Mother Nature 
Nobody here can be denied such things 
Make the ladies you love, come honey 
No butterfly should be denied it's wings 

He were a kick ass rocking horse 
He like a hell bent tied to the Gavin Pole 
It was a one time fantasy 
I got the bare bones, fly into the Holy Land 
Bare back, flyin' like a ruddered man 
Nightmares, and he can't hold a candle to my dreams 
Yeah...yeah

We rode the night 
And took to wing 
It was so alright 
It was everything 
We flew into burning skies 
The thunder and rain 
And finally realized 
What he is and what he does 
And what he couldn't say 

Oh, no, no... 
Took off in flight 
Oh, no, no...
Then came the light 

Flashback, something coming over me 
No sweat, one time fantasy
Bare boned, and all that is the wind it seems
Hell, who's the chick
That rides into my dreams 

No livery 
No stable lights 
No try to please 
Nobody's eyes 
We'll never see us again 
In time it'll pass 
And where did it all begin
But all in good time
Somebody shot an arrow 

Now tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me never 
Wakin' me 'cause you're cold somtimes 
Being seduced will be your own pleasures

From which you may never return

In a way that she could love that everybody understood

The nights were dark and dank 
And the sky, hadn't had a rain cloud in it for 25 years.... 
The buildings were dead and the alleys 
Stunk from things that used to live there 
Ahhh that wasn't the city I remembered 

A Child in the street, barefoot pullin' at his 
Mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence 
With not a scrap left on the plate 
And so much like a fable, their lives so unstable 
Cause the only thing left was their faith 
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do 
About it.... 

There's a Meltdown in the sky 
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why 
There's a fear that gets me high 
And the cold night numbs as the Jet Black clouds roll on by.... 

So sad was the scene that my eyes did behold 
Made me wonder just who was the foe 
And was it all to come true what Nostradamus 
Had predicted such a long long time ago? 
You could hear screams and moanin' 
From the people atoning 
For their sins of a guilt ridden life 
And the final door shuts 
From the wind that leaves cuts 
From the edge on the blade of God's knife 
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do about.... 

There's a Melt Down in the Sky 
There's a new day comin and I don't know why 
There's a tear stuck in my eye 
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why

Couldn't kill her if they tried

Ladies can't refuse
You love them then you leave them
With your sold out reviews

[Chorus]

Sweet talking barroom, ladies' disease
Slipping with her lips
Sliding down your knees

[Chorus]

Baby I'm a screamer
Bound to a wife in marriage
Baby, I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage
Ladies hold the aces
And their lovers call it passion
The men call it pleasure
But to me it's old fashioned
Times they're a changing
Nothing ever stands still
If I don't stop changing
I'll be writing out my will

It's the same old story
Never get a second chance
For a dance to the top of the hill

Baby I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage",126.0,
329,No Surprize ,"1971, we all heard the starters gun 
New York is such a pity 
But at Max's Kansas City we won 

We all shot the shit at the bar 
With Johnny O' Toole and his scar 
And then old Clive Davis said 
He's surely gonna make us a star 
I'm gonna make you a star
Just the way you are 

But with all his style 
I could see in his eyes 
That we is goin' on trial 
And it was no surprize 

The boys kept kickin' ass 
As usual time would tell 
But some bitch in the choir 
Throw water on the fires of hell 
She loved to show and tell 
Lord, she loved to tell 

But with all our style 
You could see in our eyes 
That we is still on trial 
And it was no surprize 
No surprize 
No surprize 
No surprize

Situation fetal 
Vaccinate your ass with your phonograph needle 

I say looky here 
Friend of mine 
You scratch like you need calamine 
Flamingo boots, soles a creakin' 
Still in love and Puerto Rican too 

Ridin' on wheels of hell 
Smokin' our axle grease 
Oh, the backstage is rockin' 
And we're coppin' from the local police 
That's right, the local police 
Or the juctice of peace 

But with all our style

Will keep the blues away

With little lost sheep.

Belly button piercings
In the sky, at night
When we're side by side

On anybody's cabriolet

More like black treacle than tar

You're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

Does it help you stay up late
Does it help you concentrate
Does it tune you in
When you chew your chin
Am I ruining your fun

And you talk the talk alright
But do you walk the walk
Or catch the train
You wanted it, you got it
But you don't want it now

Now it's getting dark

More like black treacle than tar

Behind a synthesizer
And I tried last night
To pack away the laugh
Like a key under the mat

He'll extinguish any chance of escape when he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape
And he's leaving without saying 'bye'

As solid as I can busk shock

And the weeks wait to burst like a sachet of brass

The old pantomime villian follows my coat
And he hides where it hangs and he spies through the slats


And meanwhile in the desert's only costume shop
The cowls hang and wait to rot away the identities of the willing

Drowned bags of sugar in the night
Rocketing shuttered doors despite
The shop not opening for hours

Caused bare madness in the ends,

We robbed, we stole, we loved to fight,
Smoking, drinking, joyriding,

Reckless gangsters no direction,
No sign of correction,

Changed my ways,

But like my naughty friends,
They're not phased,
Can't believe that this music pays,
See no reason why we can't do,
All the things we've always done,
Still in my heart I know thats just what,
But its hard to fight the temptation son.

and when goes...
goodbye...

arises in their hearts like rain

and when love comes
hello...

strangers in their arms are bringing

Have all turned into frowns

Her head's red raw And the ending doesn't sound like 
The happiest around 
When you sobbed before it felt much more 
Like the product of a squabble 
Now there's reason for it to be something more 

And no would be, oh, it's uncertain 
Whether the curtain has shut for good 
She says, ""See if it's still raining 
I'm not dressed for it,"" 
And ""if you loved me-"" 
And I interrupt to receive the scowl and stare
But still decided to stop her there 

Would it be outrageous to say 
We're either shouting or we're shagging 
Docked in tempestuous bays 
At least that's how it felt yesterday 
The eyes are getting heavier 
And whether you're asleep or awake 

Is a mystery 
Would a kiss be too much to ask?

Fits the thermos flask

And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb
Into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine

The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine, you keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?

Rivers of evil, run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal, and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?

When will this nightmare be over?
Tell me
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?

To safeguard my philosophy
Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a living death
I empathize with enemies
Until the timing's right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light

Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead?

The bottle took a beating
The ladies of the manor
Watched me climb into my car and
I was going down the track about a hundred and five
They had the stop-watch rolling
I had the headlights blazing I was really alive
And yet my mind was blowing
I drank a bottle of tequila and I feel real good
I had the tape deck roaring
But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn
I went of exploring
I knew I wouldn't make it the car just wouldn't make it
I was turning tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye

I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way
I had the wheels in motion
There was Peter and the Green fly laughing like drains
Inebriation
The crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch
In my imagination
But at the canal turn I hit an oily patch
Inebriation

Ooh Mr. Miracle you saved me from some pain
I thank you Mr. Miracle I won't get trashed again
Ooh can you hear my lies
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes

So we went back to the bar and hit the bottle again
But there was no tequila
Then we started on the whisky just to steady our brains
'Cos there was no tequila
And as we drank a little faster at the top of our hill
We began to roll
And as we get trashed we were laughing still

Sour life can turn sweet
It's laying at your feet

Watched closely all the while
Don't be fooled when he cries
Keep looking at the eyes

Good life is contradiction
Because of the crucifixion
If you're ready and have the need
I will take your soul and plant my seed

You just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day
You just gotta listen to the night as safety slips away
Moving out of sight are the things you need to see to feel
And as they slip away becoming so unreal unreal
You just gotta listen to the night as you're going up stairs
You just gotta listen to the night and don't forget to say your prayers
And as you lose control to the eyes in dark disguise
And icy fingers fan electric lies

We're disturbing the priest
Won't you please come to our feast
Do we mind disturbing the priest
Not at all not at all not in the least

The force of the devil is the darkness the priest has to face
The force of the night will destroy him but will not disgrace
To get into his mind and to his soul you gotta set a light
The flames of doubt so deep inside inside
The devil and the priest can't exist if one goes away

Can't you open your eyes
Voices are calling

Killing rain falling down from the sky
Crying with nightmare tears

Out on the street
You'll see blood on the ground
Cities are burning

Feeling the pain cutting right to your soul
Goodbye now

Your freedom is gone
He's taken everything
You ever had
But if you're strong you'll survive
You've got to hold on
Open your eyes

Behind the lies you will see
The master of insanity
Under the mask there will be
The master of insanity

Innocent minds
They're the victims of shame
Staring in sorrow

Promises lying there
Broken and crushed
Confusion-just disappear

What can you give
To be left all alone

One more cross to bear

See the world with electric eye

They call it mystery
But any fool could see
You thought he walked on the water

And if the pain was gone
And you were free to run away
And get out

Would you get out of there
Or do you really care

And maybe when you're gone
You just won't belong at all

And the blood in my vein's running colder
The eastern sky is beginning to silver
And the words that you speak start to falter
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed
In the house of the dead there's a taker
Some say that this is the ultimate sin
When the spirit world turns to the alter

There's been a kill in the spirit world

Behold, the dead clutching at fading hands, out of reach forever
""In glory die"" calls the voice of the void
Your assassin has cursed every spectre
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed
And the house of the dead seeks a master
Stretching every muscle, wait for the end
And a kiss on the wind, whispers murder, murder

Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say they may as well worship the sun?

Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?
You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve

Help me, tell me I'm sane

Save me, take me away
You know I've seen some creatures from hell and I've heard what they say!

To wrongly treat you unkind 
I have faith I will find

 Her lips say one thing
 Her movements something else
 Oh love...like a screaming flower
 Love...dying every hour...love

 You don't know if it's fear or desire
 Danger the drug that takes you higher
 Head in heaven, fingers in the mire

 The night is bleeding like a cut
 Between the horses of love and lust
 We are trampled underfoot

So we're preparing the nooses

And oh we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?

Blame misinformation
Misguided leaders
Apathetic hesitation
Uneducated readers
For whatever reason
We now find ourselves in this
We are all charged with treason
There is no one left to hiss

And oh we had so much time
How could we commit the worst crime?

We're the judge and the jury
The hangman, the convict
It's too late for fury
Our indictment was handpicked
So step out to the gallows
And accept your sentence
For being so shallow
You must pay a penance

From all this decay
Take it away

There's someone who cares
With a heart of gold

He shouldn't have said all the things he said 
Many tears were shed for the blood he bled

 My credit is shock, in the detinate box (box)
 Like, people take my life and thats pathetic as Pac's (Pac's)
 A waste of the talent, Say my boys is just no where
 Placed on the planet, remain in poisonous warfare
 Derelict Arabic terrorists in the air
 Shit arrogant apparent to punish people by their heritage,
 Nato barriers, Hate embarrassed
 There is the faith to cherish
 In your room face to face with race awareness
 A race to s?? army bombin' your God is with you
 Calm over war, we gotta start our pistol
 Cause if you right and, know you right, then where's your ritious ways
 We sacrafice, snatch your life, many nights and days
 Follow me into equality we might behave
 And only christ can say the trife will reunite again

 America Owns, Without a fucking care in my dome
 Bearin' my bones, so far away staring at home
 Stay at my zone, falling asleep late with my chrome
 Feelin' hype from these rockets burning like straightenin' in the cones
 Stay at the streets, bullshit and plans to beef
 Spray at your peeps for christmas, give a K to my neice
 Real nigga's feel us and fear us
 Gorillaz beat on they chest when
 Dangerous lyricist, I hope that you hear us
 The spirit of Bugz is still in me
 God bless it the trinity
 Cause my bullets they come in three's like trilogy's
 Put the knife away, missles away strike and blaze
 So much smoke you can't tell the difference between night and day
 Right away blow your life away, so light your haze
 Hold tight grenede's so when it blows I'm slightly grazed
 Kuniva might be crazed unleashin' unlikely rage
 The next time you hear a verse from me I might be caged

 Everynight I talk to a black hawk, taking herion in bulks

 Rape this old lady, while the bitch was having a baby

Sounds like a good way to build up my infamy 
Soon as Automator sent for me 
We headed over to receive our registration forms from the galactic embassy 
(Yes may I help you?) 
Remember me? 
To escape a global panic we had to intercede 
(Oh you're here for the battle forms?) 
Yeah can we get them for free? 
(I'm afraid not you'll have to pay the entry fee) 
It was worth a try when we first arrived on Mercury 
Gravity adjustment must then 
Step up contestant 
Number 12, I was 13 he started bursting ammunition that wasn't working 
His rudimentary technical abilities couldn't kill me 
Knocked me for a loop 
But I could still breathe 
He had the crowd going by appearance 
Here comes the anticipated interference from his squad and guards 
I bust back with onslought of hydrothermal clod that burnt they're third eye 
Though outnumbered I come with heat and trigger a massive explosion to the beat 
They hit me compressed air 
Left my chest bare 
My sonic stun gun takes em out by the next snare 

We won the bout just as the oxygen tanks were running out 
so we're back to the ship 
Pull a map from a blip 
Manipulate the cursor 
Recharge our essentials set the coordinates then flow 
Through a trillion miles of space with style and grace 
Next stop Pluto to rock these new flows 
Atmosphere methane, be strategic like a chess game 
Leave this emcee with chest pains 
I had to battle a shadow in his black light form 
He dazzled me adding 3 points to his score 
Engulfed my microphone with darkness adding 3 more 
The panel started to roar 
I had to find the core of his power 
He stretched his text causing me to black out 
It took my data 
I couldn't back out 
It took out the sound man I'm taking a pounding 
I bust out an a capella that's astounding 
Project a uni-beam through his spleen 
Pulled out my x-ray cannons to disintegrate the phantom 
It's not fine my cell structure ruptured 
His form will get bust up into clusters 
Shadowy masses spread to the greater darkness of outer space 
Now I'm placed 1st among artists

This is appealing

With mic in place we was off breathing frost 
in a void thinking what if we had lost? 
Ha 
Entertain an ignorant thought 
Land Ho, Sicilia we entered the port 
Fill out a few forms then we meet our challenger named qusar 
(No matter who you are I'll handle ya) 
He's a real charmer 
I threw on my pla-steel armor 
He wants to absorb the talents that I worked so hard for 
A biter hard core 
I busted a few shots and opened him like a car door 
He was a quadruped, four arms 
He hit me with four fore arms made of bronze 
I said Automater play the song 
(You got it) 
Was the theme 
Made a slight alteration in my scheme 
Set him up with a condition beam with his double team 
Leaned toward his dome piece and reamed the back of his neck

Squeezed out his brain like juice

that's workin' 'em out - Now rearrangin' your whole skeletal structure
then I find some nine inch nails to perform some accupuncture
When I punch ya, I rupture one of your rib cage in a rage
and I turn you into a cartoon toon and erase the page
I take you back to the Stone Age with Barney and Fred Flinstone
Got Dino to take a machinos and then forage in a live home
I'ma take off like a jet pack with the get back, rather step back
I'ma make the crowd react and nod they heads until they neck snap
Life conflict rap while riding a skateboard and doin' a tic-tac
and leave your head in a spin like servin' on turn table skid mats
I'm a concrete lion, big cat - These are real talk, not big-chat
Did ya get that 'cause I ain't no small timer - I rhyme on big tracks
Now feel the vise I create - This heavyweight, I'm a rap to detonate
and demonstrate how I generate lyrics that supernaturally levitate
to the top - My lyrics are skeletons - Accelerate and leave you panicin'
Take the ground from beneath your feet, leave you Skywalk-in' like Anakin
I'm sharper than the tips of Zulu spears and Olympic javelins
My style is totally buck wild and most definitely happenin'
To your brains I be tappin' in, to computers I be hackin' in
To me, I be out of this world like aliens who were time travelin'
I'm babblin' in the Fists of Fury technique when I speak
Forget Karate Kid and these wooden blocks, I chop from concrete
Concrete, concrete, concrete!
Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha!

I been stoned; ever since the days of creation, I've been red
I'm a mad dred, causin' so much havoc in Russel's head
My lyricism is just like an aneurysm inside his brain
He plays the beat in a trance and he's never feeling no pain
I could never be a racist because I posess so many faces
I'm one of those beat-up bad wit' bags and a pair of braces
with lines longer than laces - I'm gracin' you with my presence
The lyrics went flippin', makin' ya bubble like effervescence
I pulverize and bamboozle, shake numb skulls like a boodle
I smashed the top of your head with a guitar I borrowed from Noodle
I'm as animated as Japanese animes causin' callamities
Some serious savory from my roarous rhymes of reality
At the speed of sound, I'm wanderin' around - The clown done tried to defeat us
without tenacities or audacity - Don't you ever thought you could beat us
Beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us",23.0,

Trying to find a way to your heart

Lost at sea somewhere, waiting
Like setting suns at the rodeo
Trying to find someone you'll never know

Waiting to see what the morning brings
May bring sunshine on it's wings",24.0,

We're dead butterflies (Butterflies, butterflies)
Laid out on a sprung floor
Waited for a long time
To pick us up and fly (Fly, fly)
We're dеad butterflies

I'm all in, let mе know what you're thinkin'
Catch feels, wind down while we figure this out, right now (Right now, right now)
Deja que fluya pa' no perder el control
No queda de otra vamo' a tar en lo mismo
Estoy dispuesta a darte todo el cariño (Todo el cariño)

Two-steppin' while I move reckless
New sentence moves and news pendin'
Loose evidence and news trendin', effortlessly truth bendin'
Who's treacherous, searching for the feelings of a new friendship
There's but a few endings, everyone's a winner 'til you lose brethren
Old time when we use to owe time
Never take to Most High, them fuck up the old skyline
Bright lights, I hope that feeling can replenish
Regretful, 'cause if I let you left me then I'd be russ-rouletting
Got a whole full clip and pow, catch me and grip it now
But memories, lift me up, but still a man's tears dripping down
Onto these photographs of what we used to be
But overtime the puddles turns into a sea
Hoping to myself you cry a stream
I was just surfing on your grief
The hurt I can't believe, just come to terms of who was me
But who are we? These mirrors don't reflect perfection
Just put on your crep selection, come on two steps to Heaven with me

We're dead butterflies (Butterflies, butterflies)
Laid out on a sprung floor
Waited for a long time
To pick us up and fly (Fly, fly)

'Cause if it's not me then
Who's it gonna be, baby?

And instantly miss a beat create a symphony

Sailing out the doldrums of the week
The polyphonic prairies here, it's all around you

Fall through space out of mind again
Where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
Blows all the shadows far away

The falling alcohol empire, is here to hold you
Rooling out and haunted till it sinks

Your little feet, working the machine
Will it spin? will it sore?

Soothe like a wave

Closing in on the moon

1096,Fire coming out of the Monkey's head ,"Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain 
There was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived 
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world 
Obscured as it was by great clouds 

Here they played out their peaceful lives 
Innocent of the litany of excess and violence 
That was growing in the world below 
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough 
Then one day Strangefolk arrived in the town 
They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses 
But no one noticed them: they only saw shadows 
You see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were Blind. 

Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes 
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home 
Jump back from behind them and shoot them in the head 
Now everybody dancing the dance of the dead 
The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead 

In time, Strangefolk found their way into the high reaches Of the mountain 
And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable Sincerity and Beauty 
By chance, they stumbled upon the Place Where All Good Souls Come to Rest 
The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves Above all things 
And soon they began to mine the mountain 
Its rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world 
Meanwhile, down in the town 
The Happyfolk slept restlessly their dreams invaded by Shadowy figures digging away at their souls 
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain 
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives 
And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the Mountain, holes began to appear 
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the Very soul of them up 
For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful for 
They knew that soon the Monkey would soon stir from its Deep sleep 
And then came a sound, distant first 
It grew into castrophany so immense it could be heard far Away in space 
There were no screams 
There was no time 
The mountain called Monkey had spoken 
There was only fire 
And then, nothing 

Oh little town in U.S.A, your time has come to see 
There's nothing you believe you want 
But where were you when it all came down on me 
Did you call me now? ",48.0,

That might connect to something bigger
All in your mind, could follow me
You should consider
Look at the time, I'm probably later than ever
What did you find?
Well come in here, and lit them with pressure
I look to the heavens and I saw open gates
I walked up and then I pause
What the fuck did you do this for?
Wish me luck when that midnight falls

Can this be this is our time?

If my whole purpose here wasn't to speak
Now look at the time
I know that I'm early today

And this view can't be shared

And galore
And even stronger
Than the walls of Jericho

Are now for the starving

Out of sync with the seasons, not sure what I believe in
And a burden, why is bein' loved so appealin'?
Can confirm I'm alone, we're all just lost without meanin' (Jimmy Jimmy)

We coulda been rich, was poor instead
My evenings are blue, all my mornings are red
I had to make scores from gents (Jimmy Jimmy)

Kept an ace like a poker team (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

Got the money, I got stuck inside of my mind
Quick solutions was all I could find
I was earnin' but losin' my time (Jimmy Jimmy)

With a beautiful Nottin' Hill mother of five
Mental muscle, the strong will survive

[Verse 1: slowthai & 2D]
Your potential, you lack credentials
And you are special, so fucking special (Rita)
Oh, how you need it, oh, how you're needed
And you keep squeezing the truth from the middle (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
You parted seas, but your arches, they ain't golden (Ah)
And you was gangin' for some gags and now you're rollin' (Woo)
Best you shut your trap and keep it hush (Hush)
On another note, compliments make me blush
There's a hole in your pocket, so you cannot find the change
Cavern of your mind, you say your pattern
You pull your strings and you jump, hold your mouth and you say: (Ah, ah, ah)
""What was scripted, the day before it happened?""
We all give applause when people look and pause
But on the way out and get your back in
See, everything in life ain't silver and gold
But minin' for metal gave you platinum

[Refrain: slowthai]
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's weird, a thing to think light bulb don't blink
Just flickers to them, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
Makes me sick

[Verse 2: 2D]
The truth, the bills, they must be paid (Uh-huh)
And what is left and sorta atypical
All you need to change your face
You're gettin' sold, it's such a waste
You know, we could do so much better than this
Swimmin' in pools of momentary bliss
Where you gotta find a family 'cause everybody taken
They worry you keep on adding
I think you gotta crawl

[Refrain: slowthai]
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's weird, a thing to think light bulb don't blink

1155,"Out of Body (feat. Imani Vonshà, Zebra Katz & Kilo Kish) ","[Intro: Kilo Kish]
Pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down
We're here tonight for a very special offering
An offering of our spirits this evening in unison
But first a word of instruction

[Verse 1: Kilo Kish]
Hello, hello
Please leave all your belongings at the door
You can sit or stand, we can take a vote
And just tiptoe to the center of the circle
While we unveil the ropes
Still a little room left to hang your clothes
Some of us are new here, we'll take it slow
Ready, set, go
I lock hands with yours
We dive into the floor
When we reach the core
Then we stomp some more
I lock hands with yours
And then we dive down into the floor
Seven thousand miles 'till we reach the core
And then we circle back and we stomp some more
Got it?
It's just like that
You promise all your life, then you turn your back
You glide across the space, and diagonal past
Then you kick, and you jump, and you arch your back
You move your hips and your arms like a cat
Spin three times, and you're back where you're at
Does anybody catch what any of this is about?
No? Well, work it out

[Hook: Zebra Katz]
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright

[Verse 2: Kilo Kish]
Okay
Slide like a lizard, bark with the crowd
Eyes dilated, dark to the grass
Then when you find you're invisible
You melt into a puzzle
Keep it flowing like the rivers do
You gotta pay attention to the motion of the fish
Stay within the school or you're surely gonna miss
And if you lose your way, it's a cold black abyss
Don't take the chance, not worth the risk

[Hook: Zebra Katz]
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright

[Interlude: Kilo Kish]
Who knows?
There's always stains on what's real and true
Tonight is a special, special occasion
And all that's left for us to do, is move

[Bridge: Imani Vonshà]
Ooh, I, I
Where am I going?
What am I doing?
I, I'm alive
Alive
I cannot follow
I, I'm so alive
I'm so, I'm so high

[Verse 3: 2-D (Zebra Katz)]
(Everybody)
Everybody says I'm busted and blue
I feel better when I don't need that
Everybody gonna [?]
(It's so big, big, big)
Everybody says that I'm more
Feelin' out of body, I'm drinkin' it up
Can I tell you what the dream's about tonight?

Let's go
Uh, ah

You can freak me out, you can throw me in the lion pit
You can boil my hands and tell me I'm not here
I'm a mad Pac-Man, livin' in a leveled world
Everywhere I go I don't know where I am

You can call me cracked, you can call me glad and cyborg
You can load my head, and sail me into bathing light
Everybody knows, when I was sad, I fell for you
Everywhere I go, no stressin' out, no stressin' out
No stressin' out, no stressin' out, stressin' out

You can hide your head, you can throw me in the lion pit
You can boil my days and tell me I'm not blue

Uh, how can I trust truth?
Uh, when I ain't got nothin' to sell
I shattered my thoughts to get out my shell
Uh, why would I hold my tongue to tuck in my tails?
Ayy, can't dream if my ego is broke
The jokes that try to find the answer to nope
My type of drive, you can't buy this shit
You got a heart but it don't beat like this
I had a spark, then my mind went trip
Create the wave so the vibe all mix

(I'm a mad Pac-Man) 
(Livin' in a leveled world)

Yo, I been at the top of the top
Fell from the ceiling before I fail
'Cause I needed to grow, Bruce Lee, royal with the glow
Uh, walked on the edge, fuck tryna dream in the bed
'Fore I die on these meds, niggas gon' die on the feds
'Fore I make it to jail, prolly put one in the head
Fuck the judge and the prosecutor for hangin' me dead
Plus thirty and still movin', I'm close to the live, right?
Close to the live, right?
All the trauma from past never taught me to fear heights
Normal to fly now, can't be stuck in the red lights
Take flight, the life gon' bloom for the Black Knight
Keep a piece, no Buddhist, got the whole hood boomin'
I'm like a Crip how I stewed it, you on your ass, stuck, stupid
You makin' we look bad, I rock the beat, won't crash
I had to fill my bag, I had to hide my stash
You know the cops' lights flash, I had to clear my dash
I represent my flag, I gave the hood my last
Every full-grown limit, I had to change my image
The brain don't got limits, you think a mill' mean winnin'
Pigs out here skinnin', your soul ain't authentic
You died and still ain't livin'",108.0,

At the hands of the coasting queen

That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
Where the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines till they weep
With future pixels in factories far away
So call the mainland from the beach
Your heart is now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

I can't see you now my heart is frozen
All the bowses and the growses
Have been abstinated in my soul
I prayed on the immovable
Yet clinging to the atoms of rock
Seasons see adjustment signs of change
I can't see now, she said, ""Taxi""
Now that light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time every day, same routine
A clear target in the summer when skies are blue

It reverberates in my lungs
Nature's corrupted in factories far away

How much more before mine is up?

Imagine me, imagine me now (she's my collar)
I don't take her number, just don't think I'd call her
I take her down to somewhere drab and naughty
Clear my system, I don't need no other
This is my persona, secret lover (she's my collar)

Just something, you should feel nada
I know she lies alone, she's my caller
I sense her in my mind, she's my collar

She's the serpentine, she's my collar
I send a message, never call her
And now I wanna taste another

What now, a burnished plaque

Suspended in a twilight web that keeps on giving
The looping dervish in the lodge is lost within the ringing
Far away I can hear the sound of someone out there singin'
I'm speeding through the forest, strange echoes of Belarus
where presidents pin badges on disconnected youth
What would you be dreaming of?
No horse play, no diving
Cutting grass with scissors, whilst the great leaders reclining
In golden hallways where we spin
The faithful will be silent

In a sky made of diamonds

1200,The sounder ,"
You couldn't escape this music even if your name's Houdini 
Our tracks say Lah for Life and don't disappear like a Genie 
Communicating through your airwaves like a giant C.B. 
'Cause this one's for your radios or whether you recieve me 
Our music is so hot, it feels like the sun in Tahiti 
We rickety-rock, Gorillaz style is buck wild, believe me 
We heavyweights who phase ya like Ali did with Frasier 
We spit the most flava but musically, we'll amaze ya 
We've been blessed and we've been gifted like Jesus in his Manger 
Won't you shout 'Hallelujah!' Here comes your music saviour 
From your heart to your mind, your spirits to your souls, 
we've come to take control with the Gorillaz on patrol 
See, our rhymes possess the powers of a superhero 
Supernaturally we rock the mic but wit' a natural flow 
If you didn't know before, you know now - We told you so 
Gorillaz rock your dome just like the one in Tokyo 

It's a hard dream to contemplate 
I could fall into the abyss-ah 
And I love this interlude 
It's the reason to deliver 
And they called onto me 
Says they came to talk to me though 
The more of us that lies, 
I guess the kids don't live or die 

'Cause we're makin' this music that's making you lose it 
So people don't abuse it and there ain't no way for you to Refuse it 
Gorillaz be the army that's startin' this pardy-ardy 
Makin' more noise than carnivals mixed with the Mardi-Gradi 
We're comin' through your town with the sound that's so Profound 
Gorillaz with the rappers that straight from the Underground 
We're tearin' it down, makin' you feel this sort of force 
Knockin' you to your senses and knockin' you off your Course 
'Cause we're the source, got you feeling that's so Appealing 
We got you jumpin' around and bouncin' off of the ceiling 
Makin' music ya feeling from Baltimore into Bristol 
I know you're hearin' me 'cause my voice is clearer than Crystal 
The casual, supernatural flows I be exposin', 
Makin' sure that you're frozen and makin' sure that I'm Chosen 
To rip a score, makin' you damage the dance floor 
Gorillaz and Phi Life'll give you what you ask for 

It's a hard dream to contemplate 
I could fall into the abyss-ah 
And I love this interlude 
It's the reason to deliver 
And they called onto me 
Says they came to talk to me though 
The more of us that lies, 
I guess the kids don't live or die 

Let Gorillaz be your guiding light and your shining star, 
Whether you be home alone or drivin' in your car 
Don't matter who ya are, whether you be near or far, 
You'll be feelin' entertained be our music repertoire 
See, our poems, they be flowin' like rivers and resevoirs 
'Cause Gorllaz, we be out of this world like men of Mars 
We rap stars with supernatural spars 
We leave your brains amazed with this super music of ours 
So put your hands up and stand up - It's time to get down 
'Cause Gorillaz and Phi Life, we be breakin' you 'round 
From the right to the left, from the skies to the ground 
We're coverin' all angles and you can't escape the sound 
On the track, it's laid back - We've come to spray raps 
Keep it chilled and relaxed but we still sound phat 
It's like that when we write raps 
We're not from the Empire but we still Strike Back!

Where the flowers are melted and the future is fun

It feels so good to have a perfect song
It feels so good to be in total control
It feels so good to have a perfect song
It feels so good to be in total control

There were spotlights flying through the sky
From a winter wonderland, catching out
The beasts hiding in the grounds, no future, Batman
Long before Christmas, not very likely
One hundred million Viagra tablets
Starving away... in a valley

I'm going out with a bang, and the fangs of a parasite
I'm feeling alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

Say ""Sweet dreams"", etc. & ""Forever,
I hope"", said no one

She's a plastic Cleopatra on a throne of ice
She's a haemophiliac with a dying battery life
Candy-colored fingers and schadenfreude eyes
Thinkin' airbrushed thoughts with a logo on her mind

It's so delightful, it's so insightful
It's so frightful, and I'm feeling it

It's time to party
It's time to party (whoo!)

And the world you created in your image is golden

When you're in your bed
Assimilate the dopamine
Passing through your head

When you get back on a Saturday night
And the room is caving in
Do you look like me? Do you feel like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this forever?

See yourself with cupid's flame
Chipped in your head
Pay them a lie, the satellites
Passing by the edge

When you get back on a Saturday night
And your head is caving in
Do you look like me? Do you feel like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this forever?

Alive, but the war is here to stay

decide to take our last walk through the noise to the sea
Not to die but to reborn,
away from lands so battered and torn

Oh say, can you see it's really such a mess
Every inch of Earth is a fighting nest
Giant pencil and lipstick tube shaped things,
Continue to rain and cause screaming pain
And the arctic stains from silver blue to bloody red
as our feet find the sand,
and the sea is straight ahead, straight up ahead

Well it's too bad that our friends, can't be with us today
Well it's too bad
The machine, that we built,
would never save us', that's what they say

(That's why they ain't coming with us today)
And they also said it's impossible for a man to live and breathe under
water, forever,
was their main complaint
And they also threw this in my face, they said:
Anyway, you know good and well it would be beyond the will of God,
and the grace of the King (grace of the King)
(Yeah, yeah)

So my darling and I make love in the sand,
to salute the last moment ever on dry land
Our machine, it has done its work, played its part well
Without a scratch on our bodies and we bid it farewell

And I continue to burn the Midnight Lamp, alone

Now the smiling portrait of you
is still hanging on my frowning wall
It really doesn't, it really doesn't bother me too much at all
It's just the eh ever falling dust that makes it so hard for me to see
That forgotten earring laying on the floor
Facing coldly towards the door
And I continue to burn the Midnight Lamp, all alone
Burn!
Yeah, yeah
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Loneliness is such a drag!

So here I sit to face that same old fireplace
Getting ready for the same old explosion
Going through my mind
And soon enough the time will tell
About the circus in the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone who will toll my bell
And I continue to burn the same old lamp, alone
Yeah

So lonely

He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back
I'm sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
That he needs you to test his inventions.

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to.

He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it.

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to.

Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little ten women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning.

And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool

What happened to the sweet love you and me had?
Against the door he leans and starts a scene,

And so castles made of sand fall in the sea, eventually

A little Indian brave who before he was ten,
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built up a dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior Indian Cheif

Many moons past and more the dream grew strong until
Tomorrow he would sing his first war song and fight his first battle
But something went wrong, surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

And so castles made of sand melts into the sea, eventually

There was a young girl, who's heart was a frown
Cause she was crippled for life,
And she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop living,
So she decided to die

She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled you wont hurt me no more
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
Look a golden winged ship is passing my way

1241,Crystal Ball ,"As I looked into my crystal ball...
There was formed a tragedy.
Oh but there's nothing to worry about...
It was just a flash from my memory.
Well it seems that the holiday wheel...,
You know, the one that was between earth
And the moon...well any way, there was
2,000,000 killed...bodies floating in the
Afternoon...

Explosions, 1,000 or more, announcing
Tidal waves and hurricanes...
And down on earth we lost 3 continents.
Their fiery soul snuffed out by
Nature's ice and rains...

And pieces of my life...floating,
Still soaring through space...
But my sons and their wives
Landed on mars to start another race...

As I gazed upon my crystal ball,
There formed a cloud of jealousy.
But there's nothing to feel sad about...
By this time, it's due for only history.
Well, it seems that the chambers of the
Gods were being emptied for good.
Why would such heavenly beings want
To desert earth ? 
But as I watched I understood.

As the clouds turned to a jealous
Green, which was concieved in the heart
Of man...the people didn't respect
The help of the gods. instead they turned against
Immortal man. as they tried to defy, they
Died, into the wicked pits of hell.

Diana wept a tear after we made love
And said: ""my earthly darling, I must bid
You farewell...the fate of your mud brothers ...
As pieces of my life...floating,
Still soaring in space...
She could have been my wife
But her time, I didn't dare wish
To waste.

As I stared into my crystal ball,
There was formed a tearing of hearts.
Ego armies marched antly onto view
Only to be blown apart.

As the sun whispered it's secret
Through space...to men thinking the false pride
Opposite...telling them that it was
Such a disgrace to think that men were


The ruler of it. well you know
How the story goes...the sun they thought
Was their circling slave...
Round and round and round the
Table she goes. some carried
The thought right to their grave...
And I smell the scorch of the
Burnt out minds...who searched
For the hurting truth of space. and the
Dizziness they felt inside...
Reflected off the spinning
Slave pebble earth...

As fragments of my life...
Some floating, some soaring in space
Collections of my soul
Will turn complete only as time will age.

As my tears drop on my crystal ball,
Magnifies the reflections of christ.
As I blink, his angels take him away.
What he said, man tries to self
?help from god. as reward, he
Wipes our blood from his eyes...
And the cross that he would
Use for his throne represents
Not life but death. is this the way
All heroes go ? ...carrying the first necklace
Of death...
His preaching the belief
Of eternal happiness to rest.
Or were his angels just ufos
Vapor trails lead from
Another light year land...
Or was it really tomorrow's
Awakening day dream...blemished
By the smudgy finger prints of man...

And slivers of my life...floating,
Still soaring in space...
And spirits of bee hives
Even they find a resting place.

As I wander through my crystal ball,
I suddenly ride upon the waves of sound.
I see platforms of launching
Pads even before the first blade of
Grass turned brown.

And I taste their tunnels through
The sky...as the axis turns in it's womb.
Frozen flowers and animals try to
Hold positions they had before
Their morning bloomed...
And I follow the last rocket up
To the libraries of the moon's meadows.",26.0,

Pulls up to soap box door
Now a lady with a pearl handled necktie
Tied to the driver's fence
Breathes in my face,
Bourbon and coke possessed words
& ""Haven't I seen you somewhere in hell,
Or was it just an accident?""

Before I could ask ""was it the East or West side?""
My feet they howled in pain
The wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep,
But not as deep in my mind as the rain
And as they pulled away I could see her words
Stagger and fall on my muddy tent
Well I picked them up, brushed them off,
To see what they say,
And you wouldn't believe:
`Come around to my room, with the tooth in the middle,
And bring along the bottle and a president'

On a bicycle built for fools
And I seen one of my old buddies
And he say, ""you don't look the way you usually do""
I say, ""well, some people look like a coin-box""
He say, ""look like you ain't got no coins to spare""
And I laid back and I thought to myself, and I said this:
I just picked up my pride from underneath the pay phone,
And combed this breath right out of my hair
And sometimes it's not so easy
Especially when your only friend
Talk, sees, looks and feels like you,
And you do just the same as him

Just got out of a Scandinavian jail,
And I'm on my way straight home to you
But I feel so dizzy I take a quick look in the mirror,
To make sure my friend's here with me too
And you know good well I don't drink coffee,
So you fill my cup full of sand
And the frozen tea leaves on the bottom
Sharing lipstick around the broken edge
And my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on
And your cat he attacked me from his pill-box ledge
And I thought you were my friend too
Man, my shadow comes in line before you
I'm finding out that it's eh not so easy

Await their place within the ring of calm; 
Still stand to turn in seconds of release, 
Await the call they know may never come. 
In times of lightness, no intruder dared upon 
To jeopardize the course, upset the run; 
And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun 
As love in the halls of plenty overrun. 

Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast, 
Unending dances shadowed on the day. 
Within their walls, their daunting formless keep, 
Preserved their joy and kept their doubts at bay. 
Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep, 
Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray; 
And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed, 
But no one seemed to question in anyway. 

How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land 
To seek the unsuspecting and the weak; 
And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand 
Toward the foe that threatened from the deep. 
Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand 
Adrift upon a sea of futile speech? 
And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan' 
Where was your word, where did you go? 
Where was your helping, where was your bow? Bow. 
Dull is the armour, cold is the day. 
Hard was the journey, dark was the way. Way.

Roused from the keeper's sleep, 
Release the grip, throw down the key.

Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
While the hope in my hands turns to clay

From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
The hammer of the gods,
Will drive our ships to new lands,
To fight the horde singing and crying:
""Valhalla I am coming!""

On we sweep,
With thrashing oar.
Our only goal will be the western shore.

We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
How soft your fields so green,
Can whisper tales of gore,
Of how we calmed the tides of war,
We are your overlords.

On we sweep,
With thrashing oar.
Our only goal will be the western shore.

So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins,
For peace and trust can win the day despite all your losing.

Oh, throw down your plow and hoe, rest not to lock your homes. 
Side by side we wait the might of the darkest of them all.

I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, waiting for the eastern glow. 

The apples of the valley hold, the seeds of happiness, 
The ground is rich from tender care, repay, do not forget, no, no. 
Dance in the dark of night, sing to the morning light. 

The apples turn to brown and black, the tyrant's face is red. 
Oh the war is common cry, pick up you swords and fly. 
The sky is filled with good and bad that mortals never know. 

Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow, 
Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow. 

The pain of war cannot exceed the woe of aftermath, 
The drums will shake the castle wall, the ring wraiths ride in black, ride on. 
Sing as you raise your bow (ride on), shoot straighter than before. 

No comfort has the fire at night that lights the face so cold. 
Oh dance in the dark of night, sing to the morning light.

Specialist tradition, mama, let me feast my eyes 

Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 

Factory air-conditioned, heat begins to rise 
Guaranteed to run for hours, mama it's a perfect size 

Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 

Groovin' on the freeway, gauge is on the red 
Gun down on my gasoline, I believe I'm gonna crack a head. 

Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 
I can't stop talkin' about... 

Come to me for service every hundred miles 
Baby, let me check your points, fix your overdrive 

Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 

Fully automatic, comes in any size 
Makes me wonder what I did, before we synchronized 

Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 

Feather-light suspension, coils just couldn't hold 
I'm so glad I took a look inside your showroom doors 

Talkin' 'bout love (X3) 

Oh, I can't stop talkin' about love.",101.0,

She said, ""You might get hurt if you don't keep it hid"" 

Well I know my baby, If I see her in the dark 
I said I know my rider, If I see her in the dark 

Now, I goin' to Rosedale, Take my rider by my side 
Still barrelhouse, If it's on the riverside, yeah 
I know my baby, Lord, I said, ""is really sloppy drunk"" 
I know my mama, Lord, a brownskin, but she ain't no plum 

See my baby, tell her, Tell her hurry home 
Had no lovin', since my baby been gone 
See my baby, Tell hurry on home 
I ain't had, Lord, my right mind, Since my rider's been gone 

Hey, she promises, She's my rider 
I wanna tell you, She's my rider 
I know you're mine, She's my rider 
She ain't but sixteen, But she's my rider 

I'm goin' to Rosedale, Take my rider by side 
Anybody argue with me man, I'll keep them satisfied 
Well, see my baby, tell her, Tell her the shape I'm in 
Ain't had no lovin', Lord, since you know when 

Spoken: Why don't you come into my kitchen 

She's a kindhearted lady. She studies evil all the time 
She's a kindhearted woman. She studies evil all the time 

Squeeze my lemon 'til the juice runs down my leg 
Squeeze it so hard, I'll fall right out of bed 
Squeeze my lemon, 'til the juice runs down my leg 

Spoken: I wonder if you know what I'm talkin' about 

Oh, but the way that you squeeze it girl 
I swear I'm gonna fall right out of bed 

She's a good rider 
She's my kindhearted lady 
I'm gonna take my rider by my side 
I said her front teeth are lined with gold 
She's gotta mortgage on my body, got a lien on my soul 
She's my brownskin sugar plum...

Oooh...Tryin hard to change but can't let go. 
Oooh... Cryin' tears of pain and more and more. 
Oooh... Everyday is the same as the one before. 

I'm walkin' the floor over you.
I'm walkin' the floor.

Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold.
To the hand that takes your dreamless soul.

Oooh... Is it long to wait, is it much to pay? 
Oooh... Sometimes it's hard waiting for the day. 

You know it's hard. I said it's hard.
You know it's true. I said it's hard.
You know it's hard. You know it's true. 

Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost.
When you hear the call can you count the cost? 
As you stand alone do you wonder how? 
Can you step aside, does it matter now? 

Every love that's changed.
In the eye of the night. 
In the day everything.

Feeding on the wrath of man
Shot down, traumatic
Time haunted by the past
Long gone, dogmatic

Shot down, volcanic
But what is gone is gone and done
Look back, psychotic

Completely lost control
Shoot back, fanatic
Wither under looming shadow cast
Slip back, narcotic

Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On the fight, for they are right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

To make life cold and make it stick

If I can’t keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart

If a flaming heart is not that good

And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long
If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you’re all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start
And me, I’ve always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can’t put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy
If you can’t put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like Hell, the river Styx

Return again to where it's darkest
Dragging home this heathen harvest

Manipulated, propagated

Can he walk at all,

Is he alive or dead? 
Has he thoughts within his head? 
We'll just pass him there

He was turned to steel 
in the great magnetic field 
When he traveled time 
for the future of mankind 

Nobody wants him 
He just stares at the world 
Planning his vengeance 
that he will soon unfold 

Now the time is here 
for Iron Man to spread fear 
Vengeance from the grave 
Kills the people he once saved 

Nobody wants him

Nobody helps him

[Blackened: 1st Bridge (alt L4)]
Opposition - Contradiction
Premonition - Compromise
Agitation - Violation
Masturbation... On our face
Darkest color: Blistered Earth... True death of life

[Frayed Ends of Sanity: Verse 1]
Never hunger - Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure...
Struggle within triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends...

[And Justice For All: Verse 1]
Halls of Justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of Justice crushes you, overpower

[AJFA: Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you


[AJFA: Chorus]
Justice is lost - Justice is raped - Justice is gone
Pulling your strings... Justice is done
Seeking no truth - Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[AJFA: Verse 2]
Apathy, their stepping stone, so unfeeling
Hidden, deep animosity, so deceiving
Thru your eyes, their light burns, hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

[AJFA: Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

Justice is lost - Justice is raped - Justice is gone
Pulling your strings... Justice is done
Seeking no truth - Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Blackened is the end - Winter it will send
Throwing all you see into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth - Never a rebirth
Evolution's end - Never will it mend... Never

Fire, to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

 No time for cowardice, kill & survive

And my fingers seek my veins

1677,Learning To Fly,"



Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone my senses reeled
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earth-bound misfit, I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought, I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladened empty and turned to stone
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try

Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

Just feel the power gradually, and it...

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss

Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

Dogs of war and men of hate
With no cause, we don't discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather 'round and haggle
For hard cash, we will lie and deceive
Even our masters don't know
The webs we weave

One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world ... One world

Invisible transfers and long distance calls
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been taken, a silent uproar
Has unleashed the dogs of war
You can't stop what has begun
Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have a dark side, to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down
One world ... One world

The dogs of war won't negotiate
The dogs of war don't capitulate
They will take and you will give
And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door
But wherever you go
You know they've been there before
Well winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain

One world, it's a battleground
One world, and we will smash it down

A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word her honour to defend

I will, I will she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I lead the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence

One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you won't forget
There'll be no sleep in here tonight

Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life to a life
The one regret, you will never forget
There'll be no sleep in here tonight

On the turning away
From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won't understand
""Don't accept that what's happening
Is just a case of others' suffering
Or you'll find that you're joining in
The turning away""

It's a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we're all alone
In the dream of the proud

On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
Mesmerized as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It's not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there'll be
No more turning away?

One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?

A man who ran, a child who cried
A girl who heard a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

The use of force, he was so tough
She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still

He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst, he's not the best

And still this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look

A man in black on a snow white horse
A pointless life has run its course
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun

The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking

He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can't be precise
He's chained forever to a world that's departed
It's not enough, it's not enough

His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

One world, one soul
Time pass, the river rolls

And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be

There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

You got to be crazy, gotta have a real need
Gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking.

And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye, and an easy smile

You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in.

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up, fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer.

And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone
Dragged down by the stone.

I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?
Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
And everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer.

Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone

She lay in the shadow of the wave
Hazy were the visions of her playing
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her blind every time

Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned

The path you tread is narrow, and the drop is sheer and very high
The ravens all are watching from a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping like a tube-train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end? Will the final couplet rhyme?

And it's high time, Cymbaline
It's high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

A butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in, there's nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agent are both busy on the phone
Selling coloured photographs to magazines back home

And it's high time, Cymbaline

Please, wake me

The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
And suddenly it strikes you that they're moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing size

Merge with harsh realities

You find your eyes are growing moist
And all the fears never voiced
Say you have to make your final choice

To say we know the reason why?
Some are born; some men die

There'll be war, there'll be peace

Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired

The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side

Dragged by the force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon

About your doubts and fears
And what's more no-one ever disappears
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door
You can relax on both sides of the tracks
And maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
And everyone has recourse to the law

And no one kills the children anymore
No one kills the children anymore

Night after night
Going round and round my brain
His dream is driving me insane

In the corner of some foreign field
The gunner sleeps tonight
What's done is done
We cannot just write off his final scene
Take heed of the dream
Take heed

Take a fresh grip on your bulletproof mask
And if they try to break down your disguise with their questions
You can hide, hide, hide
Behind paranoid eyes

You put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar
Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar
Laughing too loud at the rest of the world
With the boys in the crowd
You can hide, hide, hide
(""I'll tell you what, I'll give you three blacks, and play you for five"")
Behind petrified eyes

You believed in their stories of fame, fortune, and glory
Now you're lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age
The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high
And you hide, hide, hide

They disembarked in '45
And no one spoke and no one smiled
There were too many spaces in the line

And gathered at the cenotaph
All agreed with hand on heart
To sheath the sacrificial knives

But now
She stands upon
Southampton Dock
With her handkerchief
And her summer frock
Clings to her wet body in the rain

In quiet desperation
Knuckles white upon the slippery reins
She bravely waves the boys goodbye again

And still the dark stain spreads between
Their shoulder blades
A mute reminder
Of the poppy fields and graves
And when the fight was over
We spent what they had made
But in the bottom of our hearts
We felt the final cut

Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes
I can barely define the shape of this moment in time
And far from flying high in clear blue skies
I'm spiralling down to the hole in the ground where I hide

If you negotiate the minefield in the drive
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes
And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall
Dial the combination, open the priesthole
And if I'm in I'll tell you (what's behind the wall)

(Wahoo!)

There's a kid who had a big hallucination
Making love to girls in magazines
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith
Could anybody love him?
Or is it just a crazy dream?

And if I show you my dark side
Will you still hold me tonight?
And if I open my heart to you
And show you my weak side
What would you do?

Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
Would you take the children away
And leave me alone?
And smile in reassurance
As you whisper down the phone
Would you send me packing?
Or would you take me home?

Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down
I held the blade in trembling hands
Prepared to make it but â just then the phone rang
I never had the nerve to make the final cut

In my rear-view mirror the sun is going down
Sinking behind bridges in the road
I think of all the good things
That we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions
Confirm suspicions
Of the holocaust to come

The rusty wire
That holds the cork
That keeps the anger in
Gives way
And suddenly it's day again

The sun is in the east
Even though the day is done
Two suns in the sunset
Could be the human race is run

Like the moment when the brakes lock
And you slide towards the big truck
Oh, no
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear

And you'll never hear their voices
Daddy, daddy, 
And you'll never see their faces
You have no recourse to the law anymore

And as the windshield melts
And my tears evaporate
Leaving only charcoal to defend
Finally I understand
The feelings of the few
Ashes and diamonds
Foe and friend
We were all equal in the end

Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

Waiting to weed out the weaklings
Waiting to smash in their windows and kick in their doors

Waiting for the final solution to strengthen the strain

There's no need for the jury to retire.
In all my years of judging
I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving the full penalty of law.
The way you made them sufferâ
Your exquisite wife and motherâ

Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning
Under the eaves the swallow is resting

Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine
When one inch of love is one inch of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine

Making the shape of his question to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?

And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea

The darkness in the North
Weary strangers' faces show their sympathy
They've seen that hope before

Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your aching eyes, be on your way

Mist is swirling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar get louder in your ears
You know, the folly was your own
But the force behind can't conquer all your fears

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit

And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say

Throw your thoughts back many years
To the time when there was life in every morning
Perhaps a day will come
When the lights will be as clear as on that morning

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit

And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your aching eyes, be on your way

The mob it cries for blood
To twist the tale
Into fire wood
Fan the flames
With a little lie

Until the fire dies
The skin it peels
Like the truth, away

Keep your mouth shut

Make up something good...

He walks the streets of life
But he's in chains
I'm alive he cried

Burning red inside
I am an Indian brave
There is a memory
That lives in my blood
Of the grand you laid
On all you touched
But the burning flame
Turns to burning pain
Genuine genocide
And that's truly insane
So like a wild hurricane
I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died
When it should have been saved

A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard

Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
Cobain can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off  station to station
And Alderaan's not far away

1938,Can't Stop ,"Can't stop addicted to the shindig
Chop top he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunct the pistol that you pay for
This punk the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East Side lovers living on the West End
Knock out but boy you better come to
Don't die you know the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burning so bright I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screaming in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers

The world I love
The tears I drop
To be part of
The wave can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you
The world I love
The trains I hop
To be part of
The wave can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snowcone
So smart she's leading me to ozone
Music the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight the gold of meditation
This chapter's going to be a close one
Smoke rings I know you're going to blow one
All on a spaceship persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love
The tears I drop
To be part of

Ever wonder if it's all for you

Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
How about you
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew

Go write your message on the pavement
Burning so bright I wonder what the wave meant 

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering

Reminded me to say the other way was right
She's in a place to pray for me
And now we've got to flash the funky light
You've got your way and it seems I've got mine

Let me catch my breath
Let me see whats left
Let me see whats true
Do I really want to
Run from my depths
Will I have regrets
Will I ever find you
Will I ever find words
That give me motive to express

Bread
Will I go unfed
Will I be that who rushes on in
To where angels fear to tread
Was it me who bled
On the new death bed
And there is no fear
When you’re leaning on love
Those greatful dead

Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone I do
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know
The ending, the must

Chess, let me play my best
When I do regress, let it all unwind
‘Cause we’re never confined
To the board unless
Less I second guess
Look into the sky where we all comply
With something higher than the
Rest of my love, sail through

Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone I do
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know
The ending, the must

Sky all around
Fell to the ground
Now I’m a child
Stayed for a while

Flesh is it meaning less
But we all protest
To the last request
Is there anything you
Could now suggest
Did I do my best
Did I leave it better
Even though we look to be
Just mildly obsessed with you
Sail through

To research the meaning of love
Someone I do
To be there when push comes to shove

and tragic characters in a smog filled

to set-a-set it straight
you know the lie is dead
so give yourself a break
get it through your head
get if off your chest
get it out your arm
because it's time to start fresh
you want to stop dying
the life you could be livin'

I've got to take a number
cause I've been to that doctor
and believe me that's a bummer

1994,Green Heaven ,"About this planet, there is something I know
There's a very big difference between above and below
A friend foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow

Here, above land, man has laid his plan
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan
We got a government so twisted and bent
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution
If you think you're just away, you're in a mental institution
And that's a heart felt shame
'Cos everyone's crazy, everyone's the same
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?

Time now to take you to a different place
Where peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space
A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace
A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none
'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun
No one tells 'em how their life is run
And no one points at them with a gun
They have a lot of love for every living creature
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature
They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you

Back to the land of the police man
Where he does whatever he says he can
Including hating you because you're a Jew
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new
Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all
They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail
So support your police, support your local wars
That's the way to open economic doors
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore
We assume the position to sell the ammunition
What the fuck? It's the american tradition
Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?",95.0,

Makin' my way I brake another L.A. day
Time in the town I need it for my love
My Chevrolet rollin' to another play day

I met a girl who wants to save the world
Make it safe

Left the backdoor swinging 
Like a dirty little sleuth

The truth is I have never 
Felt half this alive

Upon the grave called 45

Jacked up on some Kerouac 
And surely bullet proof

Was missing her front tooth

Inside of yesterday
Hey let's run around
The great escape 
From out of my hometown

Later I would look for love 
Inside a woman's dorm
A couch to keep me humble 
And her breath to keep me warm

Ophelia was the girl 
That I was feeling for
Come to realize 
It was me who was the whore

A captain lost himself 
Inside a 40 year old skull
The drink of choice was knowledge 
And we always wanted more

Drunken sailors 
Seeking their Geronimo
Instead they found the things 
That they really didn't wanna know

I say so long

Would never let me stay
The way I played 
Inside of yesterday

A devil's growl and cat's meow 
Were blended into one
Termites called suburbanites 
Were eating all the fun

A juggernaut of comedy 
And blasphemy
I wanna stop the madness 
But I think it has to be

Can’t stop crying

The baddest of guys

Want me dead
She fires up the starry night
And fills them so full
So full of lead

Wake up flying

For the various and not necessarily contrary shell show
She said, ""Hell no""
The cock bottom temple varies like autumn lights soft the cost
The Fibonacci lost her sauce
Into the last remaining hostage boss, sweet toss

The not yet fractured tabernacle of the Basil Rathbone

Impassible laughter blocks my path

I got a million more that'll take me away 
All those people starvin' everyday
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay 

Well I'm a millionaire too, but not like you 
As far as I'm concerned, I got a job to do 
I've got to pave the way, I've got to save the day 
I've got to make it better, I've got to say 
You and I, we're millionaires, but we're a million miles away from the saint who stares 
Upon the millions who die, every day of the week 
Just because they can't get enough to eat 
While we the rich dine on all these feasts, and everything's fine, yeah peaches and creme 
But it just isn't something you've got to realize, there's something wrong, we've got to open our eyes 
When the world cries, we just can't hide, we've got a job to do, we've got to save some lives 

We're millionaires 
Against hunger 

Hey hey Mr. Millionaire 
Twice as nice when you share 
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire 
A spiritual price do you care 
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire 
Nice and Wise when you share 
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire 
Pave the way, take the Grail 

I'm a millionaire 
And I got something to say 
I got three or four yachts on the Chesapeake Bay
All those people starvin' everyday
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay 

Well I'm a millionaire too 
All I know that is true is that I've got more cash than I can use 
I want anything that I can have, but I don't need nothin' and I never have 
Each damn day my heart's set far, but I'll be okay, cuz I don't starve 
Kids from the street the losing their emotion so damn snobby so out of touch 
With two hungry people who die as they stare at the city at night, you know it gives to share 
So listen up, you millionaires, every woman, every man, help all you can 
All races unite, and I will now concern to the type of problem that helps us learn 

We're millionaires 
Against hunger 

Hey hey Mr. Millionaire

Naw, she's not busted, he just wanted to smack her on the ass a few times and say ""Hey, what's up, girl?""

So I remember we got our driver's license, and my friend Hillel had this little Dodson, painted green, and...
Hollywood would get so crazy in the winter--the rains would come and the hills would just kind of melt down into the city lights,
and, well, you know, we smoked weed and we'd go up in the hills and we'd listen to progressive rock music and just kind of trip out and...
well, we would dream, you know, we would dream, and we would talk about what we wanted to do, and we would talk about girls and music,
and, you know, Hillel wanted to be a rock star--I didn't even know what that was, I was like, whatever you wanna do, man, I'm coming with you.
I'm right with you, my friend.

Can't they just spell it out, make it clear, make it easy to read for the simple man like me? 
I don't think so 
I reach out to my family and I say 
It's not about religion and the God sitting in a chair in the sky with a punishing hand, oh
It's about heaven in your heart

Are you laced up?
Well, are you really clean?

Can't refuse it

Filling up your head with a bathtub rose

Break this fall, the excellence has it's

Hard as nails but soft to wear
Rooftop crops up
And a folding chair
Pay your thug store Hench

With the golden wrench
Locomotive smoke to cover up what's broke
Please don't seize me
Until you get my joke

You can't afford a cigarette

Knock the world right off its feet
And straight onto its head

A perfect Frankenstein
Out on that lone pine
I'm gonna make you mine

It's understood you wrap
Your voodoo right around my neck
You've got some glitter on your

I put my lovin' in your oven
Not a head to check

Born into it that's for sure

Do you really need another souvenir

Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
Chase your tail my baby it'll be your last

With his galleons and guns
Looking for the new world
In that palace in the sun

On the shore lay montezuma
With his coca leaves and pearls
In his halls he often wandered
With the secrets of the worlds.

And his subjects gathered 'round him
Like the leaves around a tree
In their clothes of many colours
For the angry gods to see.

And the women all were beautiful
And the men stood straight and strong
They offered life in sacrifice
So that others could go on.

Hate was just a legend
And war was never known
The people worked together
And they lifted many stones

They carried them to the flatlands
And they died along the way
But they built up with their bare hands
What we still can't do today.

And i know she's living there
And she loves me to this day
I still can't remember when
Or how i lost my way.

my garden bower; dig?
Royal babies, rubies
must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal
for the plant that's plowed
they are waiting to take us into
the severed garden
Do you know how pale & wanton thrillful
comes death on a stranger hour
unannounced, unplanned for
like a scaring over-friendly guest you've
brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
& gives us wings
where we had shoulders
smooth as raven's
claws
No more money, no more fancy dress

I tasted fear. I musta' been about four - like a child is
like a flower, his head is just floating in the
breeze, man.

soul. And they're still in there.

And choose the sign of your day,
The day's divinity.
First thing you see.

A vast radiant beach
And a cool jeweled moon.
Couples naked race down
By its quiet side,
And we laugh like
Soft mad children
Smug in the wooly
Cotton brains of infancy.

The music and voices
Are all around us.

Choose they croon
The ancient ones,
The time has come again.
Choose now they croon
Beneath the moon
Beside an ancient lake.
Enter again the sweet forest.
Enter the hot dream
Come with us.
Everything is broken up
And dances.

Dawn's highway bleeding,
Ghosts crowd the young child's
Fragile egg-shell mind.",41.0,

Women flowering in their summit
Monsters of skin
Each color connects

which rocks the race

I can forgive my injuries in the name of

Words are the healing lament
For the death of my cock's spirit
Has no meaning in the soft fire

A tounge of knowledge in the feathered night
Boys get crazy in the head and suffer

Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming 
A beast caged in the heart of a city 
The body of his mother 
Rotting in the summer ground 
He fled the town 

He went down South and crossed the border 
Left the chaos and disorder 
Back there over his shoulder 

One morning he awoke in a green hotel 
With a strange creature groaning beside him 
Sweat oozed from its shiny skin 

Is everybody in? 
The ceremony is about to begin 

Wake up! 
You can't remember where it was 
Had this dream stopped? 
The snake was pale gold 
Glazed and shrunken 
We were afraid to touch it 
The sheets were hot dead prisons 

Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom 
Look! 
I can't live thru each slow century of her moving 
I let my cheek slide down 
The cool smooth tile 
Feel the good cold stinging blood 
The smooth hissing snakes of rain . . . 

Once I had, a little game 
I liked to crawl back into my brain 
I think you know the game I mean 
I mean the game called 'go insane' 
Now you should try this little game 
Just close your eyes forget your name 
Forget the world forget the people 
And we'll erect a different steeple 
This little game is fun to do 
Just close your eyes no way to lose 
And I'm right there I'm going too 
Release control we're breaking thru 

Way back deep into the brain 
Back where there's never any pain 
And the rain falls gently on the town 
And in the labyrinth of streams 
Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of 
Nervous hill dwellers in the gentle hills around 
Reptiles abounding 
Fossils, caves, cool air heights 

Each house repeats a mold 
Windows rolled 
Beast car locked in against morning 
All now sleeping 
Rugs silent, mirrors vacant 
Dust blind under the beds of lawful couples 
Wound in sheets 
And daughters, smug 
With semen eyes in their nipples 

Wait 
There's been a slaughter here 

(Don't stop to speak or look around 
Your gloves and fan are on the ground 
We're getting out of town 
We're going on the run 
And you're the one I want to come 

Not to touch the earth 
Not to see the sun 
Nothing left to do, but 
Run, run, run 
Let's run 
House upon the hill 
Moon is lying still 
Shadows of the trees 
Witnessing the wild breeze 
C'mon baby run with me 
Let's run 
Run with me 
Run with me 
Run with me 
Let's run 

The mansion is warm, at the top of the hill 
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there 
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs 
And you won't know a thing till you get inside 
Dead president's corpse in the driver's car 
The engine runs on glue and tar 
C'mon along, we're not going very far 
To the East to meet the Czar 

Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake 
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake 
Who lives in a well by the side of the road

I can tell you 
The things that you know 
Listening for a fistful of silence 
Climbing valleys into the shade 

I am the Lizard King 
I can do anything 
I can make the earth stop in its tracks 
I made the blue cars go away 

For seven years I dwelt 
In the loose palace of exile 
Playing strange games

2409,The Peking King And The New York Queen ,"Well, I heard a story you can judge it's worth
About the sun and the moon
This time they came down to earth
They passed in the heavens each day up above
Time after time and it soon became love
They could not touch, they could not kiss
They had no flesh, no earthly bliss
So they made a scheme, they made a plan
They would come down to earth as a woman and a man
She rode a lunar wave, he flew a solar beam
They took on human forms to live out a dream
The most beautiful people that I've ever seen
They were the Peking King and the New York Queen
I said the Peking King and the New York Queen.
As fate would have it in the toss of the dice
They went to opposite ends of this world of our lives
Opposite eyes, opposite minds
Such things matter in these troubled times.
Peking in the East and New York in the West
Each place thought that it was the best
But the sun and the moon on their earthly quest
Knew without a doubt that it was all the best
They said what does it matter how you read a book
It's all the same no matter how it looks.
Well the only thing important to the Peking King
Was bein' in the arms of his New York Queen
Thousand of miles, they were so far apart
How to get together? Oh, where to start?
On the California Zephyr and the Shanghai Express
He headed to Hong Kong, she headed out west.
No passports, no visas, no government quotas
No secret missile sites in South Dakota
No red tape, no red guard could stop the dream
Of the Peking King and the New York Queen
I said, the Peking King and the New York Queen
Well they found a little island in the Philippines
It was a perfect little place to live out a dream
They say East is East, West is West
They say the twain won't meet, but don't you take that bet
'Cause you're invited to a wedding and to share the dream

Staring at me from the tv

Royal babies, rubies
Must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal
For the plant that’s plowed.

They are waiting to take us into
The severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful
Comes death on a strange hour
Unannounced, unplanned for
Like a scaring over-friendly guest you’ve
Brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
And gives us wings
Where we had shoulders
Smooth as raven’s
Claws

No more money, no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
Until it’s other jaw reveals incest
And loose obedience to a vegetable law.

Prefer a feast of friends
To the giant family.",127.0,

2434,"Whiskey, mystics and men ","Well, I’ll tell you a story
of whiskey and mystics and men,
And about the believers and
how the whole thing began.
First there were women and
children obeying the moon,
Then daylight brought wisdom
and fever and sickness too soon.
You can try to remind me
instead of the other, you can.
You can help to insure
that we all insecure our command.
If you don’t give a listen,
I won’t try to tell your new hand.
This is it; can’t you see
that we all have our ends in the band.

And if all of the teachers and
preachers of wealth were arraigned,
We could see quite a future
for me in the literal sands.
And if all the people
could claime to inspect such regrets,
well, we’d have no forgiveness,
forgetfullness, faithful remorse.
So I tell you, I tell you,
I tell you we must send away.
We must try to find a
new answer instead of a way.",150.0,
2435,Who Do You Love ,"I walked 47 miles on barbed-wire,
Got a cobra-snake for a necktie.
I built a house by the roadside,
Made of rattlesnake hide.
Got a brand new chimney up on top,
Made out of human skulls.
Come on baby take a walk with me,
And tell me who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Tombstone head and a graveyard mind,
I'm just 22 and I don't mind dying.
Rode around the town with a rattlesnake whip,
Come on baby don't give me no lip.
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
The night is dark, the sky was blue,
Down the alley the ice wagon flew.
Hit a bump, somebody screamed,
You should'a heard just what I seen.
Who, baby, who do you love?
What do you love, now?
Love, love, love me girl.

Coming down the road.

Carrying a heavy load.

And one bag of gold.",152.0,
