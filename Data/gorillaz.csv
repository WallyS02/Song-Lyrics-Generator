[Proof]
 There ain't no trouble in rock (rock)
 On every block (block)
 Late for School, Late for Work
 But ahead of these cops (cops)
 My credit is shock, in the detinate box (box)
 Like, people take my life and thats pathetic as Pac's (Pac's)
 A waste of the talent, Say my boys is just no where
 Placed on the planet, remain in poisonous warfare
 Derelict Arabic terrorists in the air
 Shit arrogant apparent to punish people by their heritage,
 Nato barriers, Hate embarrassed
 There is the faith to cherish
 In your room face to face with race awareness
 A race to s?? army bombin' your God is with you
 Calm over war, we gotta start our pistol
 Cause if you right and, know you right, then where's your ritious ways
 We sacrafice, snatch your life, many nights and days
 Follow me into equality we might behave
 And only christ can say the trife will reunite again

[Kuniva]
 America Owns, Without a fucking care in my dome
 Bearin' my bones, so far away staring at home
 Stay at my zone, falling asleep late with my chrome
 Feelin' hype from these rockets burning like straightenin' in the cones
 Stay at the streets, bullshit and plans to beef
 Spray at your peeps for christmas, give a K to my neice
 Real nigga's feel us and fear us
 Gorillaz beat on they chest when
 Dangerous lyricist, I hope that you hear us
 The spirit of Bugz is still in me
 God bless it the trinity
 Cause my bullets they come in three's like trilogy's
 Put the knife away, missles away strike and blaze
 So much smoke you can't tell the difference between night and day
 Right away blow your life away, so light your haze
 Hold tight grenede's so when it blows I'm slightly grazed
 Kuniva might be crazed unleashin' unlikely rage
 The next time you hear a verse from me I might be caged

[Chorus]
 Aaaahhhiyyyaaaa
 Ahhhayayayayay
 Aaaahhhiyyyaaaa
 Ahhhayayayayay

[Bizarre]
 Everynight I talk to a black hawk, taking herion in bulks
 Watch my body hit the chalks
 I'm too lazy, mescalines got me crazy
 Rape this old lady, while the bitch was having a baby
 And I ain't never going home, Bizarre can for go
 It's cold I'll be for cyphering, right from wrong
 As I sit in my seat and remain calm
 And close my eyes and wait for the bomb (Here it comes!)

[Airplane Blows Up]

[Swifty]
 I'm gettin' the fuck on, I'm aggrivated
 I know I'll make it, Im in a place full of hatred
 Treatin' my life like a sacrred
 Try to check me, I break your neck
 Disrespect me you get injected
 It's hectic with some bullshit that happen
 You least expected
 We just don't accept it nigga
 I go ahead, lift my trigger
 Get rid of bitches, pay you a visit, then get your shit lit
 I'm a nitwit with a big dick, and big balls
 I don't miss shit
 I hit all, whoever that did this
 We Gonna Getch'all

[Kon Artis]
 Yo, yo
 Now whether its Sadam or Bin Laden
 Thats been startin all this trouble for us
 Creepin horrors doin show after show, sleepin on the tour bus
 We lost Aaliyah, lost our families, it takes no Tenges
 You dont need us to say the world is fucked up dawgs can see it
 Now it seems the public needs this shit to calm its kids
 Cuz they findin out how you lied about your twisted sins
 They say we bad for you but shit our music is your friend
 They cant deter you from the truth cause we the helping hand

 We are one, and one is all
 We are, We are, we are one
 And one is all

Snatch a piece of my wonderin'
Distant-far like yonderin'
Skin of my tooth like
Seat of my boot like
Fly in my soup like
Where's the waitress?
Can't take this, really can't finish this
These ears and all these graces
It's my mistake, i make it
J-dub to the boom now make it
Bounce-wiggle bounce-wiggle
Shakin' all them bangs out
Chemical cutthroats
Bound to blow the brain out
Cut to the brain
This ain't no game
I'll show no shame
I'll birth this blame
I'm twisted cain
I'll twist again
I'll push the blade
As plain as day
Known to what these sayers say
Known to what these doers do
We shoot where who and you-know-where
We's about to take it there
We's about to make it clear
We happy or we lonesome
The long jump, the beat heart, from start to finish
Ten spoons of spinach
The soul and the spillage
The cup that runneth ovah
Return of the OGAH!

Chorus

Close your eyes and see
When there ain't no light
All you'll ever be
Come on save the night
'Cause i don't believe
When the morning comes, it doesn't
Seem to say an awful lot to me"
7,Amarillo ,"The mountains are waiting
The full moon has come

I got lost on the highway
But don't ask me where I've been
Or what I've done

Oh lord send me transmissions
Forgive me for what I've become

The sun has come to save me
Put a little love into my
Lonely soul

The sun has come to save me
Put a little love into my
Lonely soul

Well don't you know why
You need her loving you?

Float inside..."
8,Andromeda ,"When the passing looks to die for
Take it in your heart now love her
When the case is out
And tired and sodden
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart

Back to when it was cool
'Cause there's no substitute
Who even knows the truth?
The truth, the truth

Take it in your heart now, love her
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Where it all goes down

Outside cold, it ghosting out with jet lag
I took it to the right man
Took it all back
When the courts were closing
It was Bobby gracing
I know that
I put it to the right man
He put it back

Caught in your eyes
Stacks of lights
Come streaming back
Make it for the best times
Growing pains, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times

Take it in your heart now, love her
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart
Where it all goes down

Andromeda
Andromeda, Andromeda
Take it in your heart now, love her
Andromeda, Andromeda
Andromeda, Andromeda
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart
Where it all goes down"

[Verse 1: 2-D]
I'm looking out at a volcano
Trying to read the world today and see where you're at
I'll never do that
I'm a model that is uncomplicated
You can play a happy tune on me, but don't turn me off
'Cause then I am silenced

[Verse 2: 2-D]
I'm standing on a beach in the distance
And even though you're far away, can you see my red light?
It's waiting to turn green
'Cause I feel so isolated without you
I can't play a happy tune on my own, so stay by my side
High or low tide

[Chorus: 2-D & Peter Hook]
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
And it feels like I'm falling in, again
My side, my side, my side, my side
My side, my side, my side, high tide, high
Feels like I'm falling in, again

[Verse 3: 2-D]
I'm a model that is uncomplicated
You can play a happy tune on me, but don't turn me off
'Cause then I am silenced

[Chorus: 2-D & Peter Hook]
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
And it feels like I'm falling in, again
My side, my side, my side, my side
My side, my side, my side, high tide, high
Feels like I'm falling in, again"
10,Ascension ,"You are now tuned into the tomb of Jehova
Play my tunes loud enough to shake the room, what's the hold up?

She wet like Barbra Streisand
Police everywhere
It's like a nigga killed a white man
I just wanna find a baby mama 'fore the night end
So don't be coming 'round here
On that batter right shit
On that 911 shit
Need a misses brown as Missy
I can have some fun with
Them slave bones make Grace Jones'
Don't stop, bitch, stay focused
They hated on us since days of Moses
Let my people go crazy
Them stars falling, don't chase 'em

Attack on Iraq
It's on a line
Typing it fast
Then it's slipping my mind
Oh when I'm drunk
I'm spirited back
I fall in a fire then I save myself
Then I get advantage
'Cause the feeling's so raw
In these times of sedition
Nothing is dull
And I'm moving into stillness
I'm recalling it all
And I’m a lover just a lover just a lover just a lover

The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)

All these liberated women sitting in my lap
I'm finna catch a body like I got a gun and badge
I'm finna turn Obama to my patna 'fore he dash
Pull up to his pad, wipe my ass with the flag
I'm just playing, baby, this the land of the free
Where you can get a Glock and a gram for the cheap
Where you can live your dreams long as you don't look like me
Be a puppet on a string, hanging from a fucking tree
(AGHH)

Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)

11,Baby Queen ,"[Verse 1: 2-D]
I met the princess from Thailand again
She had grown up
Into a queen
Down in the abyss where the night
Never turns to daylight
She kept me in a Polaroid
That was pinned up on her wall
Under Garuda's mirror lights
She takes flight
Yeah the kid's alright

[Chorus: 2-D]
You've grown up
Baby Queen
You've grown up
Baby Queen (You've grown up)

[Verse 2: 2-D]
She fell into the generals (Oh, Baby Queen)
On the watch all around her
I fell into the vanity
The mirrored lights of our dreams

[Chorus: 2-D]
You've grown up (Baby Queen)
In my dreams where you've been (Dreams, dreams, dreams)
You've grown up (Baby Queen)
In my dreams where you've been (Dreams, dreams, dreams)
(Baby Queen)
In my dreams where you've been (Dreams, dreams, dreams)
You've grown up (Baby Queen)
In my dreams where you've been (Dreams, dreams, dreams)
You've grown up (Baby Queen)
In my dreams where you've been (Dreams, dreams, dreams)

You were in my dreams"
12,Battlesong ,"Interplanetary adversaries battling for supremacy 
Sounds like a good way to build up my infamy 
Soon as Automator sent for me 
We headed over to receive our registration forms from the galactic embassy 
(Yes may I help you?) 
Remember me? 
To escape a global panic we had to intercede 
(Oh you're here for the battle forms?) 
Yeah can we get them for free? 
(I'm afraid not you'll have to pay the entry fee) 
It was worth a try when we first arrived on Mercury 
Gravity adjustment must then 
Step up contestant 
Number 12, I was 13 he started bursting ammunition that wasn't working 
His rudimentary technical abilities couldn't kill me 
Knocked me for a loop 
But I could still breathe 
He had the crowd going by appearance 
Here comes the anticipated interference from his squad and guards 
I bust back with onslought of hydrothermal clod that burnt they're third eye 
Though outnumbered I come with heat and trigger a massive explosion to the beat 
They hit me compressed air 
Left my chest bare 
My sonic stun gun takes em out by the next snare 

We won the bout just as the oxygen tanks were running out 
so we're back to the ship 
Pull a map from a blip 
Manipulate the cursor 
Recharge our essentials set the coordinates then flow 
Through a trillion miles of space with style and grace 
Next stop Pluto to rock these new flows 
Atmosphere methane, be strategic like a chess game 
Leave this emcee with chest pains 
I had to battle a shadow in his black light form 
He dazzled me adding 3 points to his score 
Engulfed my microphone with darkness adding 3 more 
The panel started to roar 
I had to find the core of his power 
He stretched his text causing me to black out 
It took my data 
I couldn't back out 
It took out the sound man I'm taking a pounding 
I bust out an a capella that's astounding 
Project a uni-beam through his spleen 
Pulled out my x-ray cannons to disintegrate the phantom 
It's not fine my cell structure ruptured 
His form will get bust up into clusters 
Shadowy masses spread to the greater darkness of outer space 
Now I'm placed 1st among artists 

Serve due more space travel 
Computer 
(Yes deltron) 
What have you 
Next destination 
The colony of Sicilia an earth colony 
This is appealing 
Hyperspace 
With mic in place we was off breathing frost 
in a void thinking what if we had lost? 
Ha 
Entertain an ignorant thought 
Land Ho, Sicilia we entered the port 
Fill out a few forms then we meet our challenger named qusar 
(No matter who you are I'll handle ya) 
He's a real charmer 
I threw on my pla-steel armor 
He wants to absorb the talents that I worked so hard for 
A biter hard core 
I busted a few shots and opened him like a car door 
He was a quadruped, four arms 
He hit me with four fore arms made of bronze 
I said Automater play the song 
(You got it) 
Was the theme 
Made a slight alteration in my scheme 
Set him up with a condition beam with his double team 
Leaned toward his dome piece and reamed the back of his neck 
With a cranial disruption siphon 
Squeezed out his brain like juice 
Like a python "

15,Broken ,"Distant stars
Come in black or red
I've seen their worlds
Inside my head

They connect 
With the fall of man
They breathe you in
And dive as deep as they can

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising

There's nothing you can say to him
He is an outer heart
And the space has been broken

It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken

Is it far away in the 
Glitter Freeze
Or in our eyes
Every time they leave

It's by the light
Of the plasma screens
We keep switched on
All through the night while we sleep

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising

There's nothing you can say to her
I am without a heart
And the space has been broken

It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken"
16,Busted and Blue ,"Where does it come from?
When everything was outside
Busted and blue
How in the universe
Through the lithium
Busted and blue

I was asked by a computer
A shadow on the wall
An image made by Virgil
To rule over us all
So amplify the sirens
And to find real amends
I'm through the echo-chambers
To other worlds away

All my life
All my life
Be my light
On me, I am a satellite
And I can't get back without you
Be my love
Be my love
Be my light
Be my light

Where do they come from?
The wires that connect to us
Weightless and fall on your body
'Till we're invisible
I'm with you throughout it, choose
Busted and blue

All my life
All my life
Be my light
On me, I am a satellite
And I can't get back without you
Be my love
Be my love
Be my light
Be my light

Busted and blue"
17,California And The Slipping Of The Sun ,"California
an ocean now I come again before you
all alone with you
in the slipping of the sun

set on dreamers

repeats the faithful ones again
like water of the mountains that
it's the slipping of the sun..."

Carnival

We play to win, just to find the dark

Keep you satisfied, while they rob us blind

Singing, singing

Oh, I haven't see the glory
Coming, coming coming
And we play
We play, we play, we play like a-

19,Chalk Tablet Towers ft. St. Vincent ,"Chalk tablet towers, like drawing shadows
Chemical distraction, you are not with me
I departed in the spring, to a distant star
But I could not get back, I had gone too far (O-o-o-oh)

I wanna get drunk
I wanna get stoned
I wanna give up
I wanna go ho-o-o-ome

Watching rockets take off from the parting sea
How will I ever touch you if you are not with me? (O-o-o-oh, out here)
There's only silence (Out here) No form of contact (Out here)
I am dreaming, looking into the darkness (O-o-o-oh)

I am the sword
I am the ghost

[Chorus (Variation): 2-D and Grace Jones]
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
Everything is supposed to get in
I just don't know where I'm a-getting from
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
What is the cause of it, and
Well in that case, how do you know it's your own?
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
What do you say now?
Thought you could [?] when the flowers have grown
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
What did you do in it?
I bet you're racing it, I'm left in a stew, chikuchi

[Outro: Grace Jones and 2-D]
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
No antennas
(A cha-charger)
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
No antennas
(A cha-charger)
I'm gonna take you for a ride
(A cha-charger)
I'm inside you
No antennas

22,Clint Eastwood ,"I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

Yeah, ha-ha
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now time for me is nothing 'cause I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs
And I'm under each snare
Intangible
Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view
Look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose
Sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual
Hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy
Lifeless
To those the definition for what life is
Priceless
To you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it?
Gun smokin' righteous with one toke
You're psychic among those
Possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future (that's right) is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

The essence, the basics
Without, did you make it?
Allow me to make this
Child-like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child of peace
Every cloud and sea
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise (that's right)
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me as a guide
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'ma stick around with Russ' and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head"
23,Clint Eastwood (Phi Life Cypher Version) ,"Yo. Yo.

'Cause I'm this, Gorillaz from the mist lyricist and my thoughts be twisted
I spit the wickedest rhymes from a time that's never existed
My futuristic linguistics turn fools into statistics
I'm a lyrical misfit with the sadistic characteristics
I perform murderous acts on my tracks with a single breath
and if a boy wanna test, then I be stampin' upon his chest
Done makin' a mess - Not a man could concieve the weed I'm consumin'
and I transform from my cartoon pseudonym, turn to a human
I spit words from my mouth that be turnin' you inside out
and I tie knots in intestines just like I'm a boy scout
that's workin' 'em out - Now rearrangin' your whole skeletal structure
then I find some nine inch nails to perform some accupuncture
When I punch ya, I rupture one of your rib cage in a rage
and I turn you into a cartoon toon and erase the page
I take you back to the Stone Age with Barney and Fred Flinstone
Got Dino to take a machinos and then forage in a live home
I'ma take off like a jet pack with the get back, rather step back
I'ma make the crowd react and nod they heads until they neck snap
Life conflict rap while riding a skateboard and doin' a tic-tac
and leave your head in a spin like servin' on turn table skid mats
I'm a concrete lion, big cat - These are real talk, not big-chat
Did ya get that 'cause I ain't no small timer - I rhyme on big tracks
Now feel the vise I create - This heavyweight, I'm a rap to detonate
and demonstrate how I generate lyrics that supernaturally levitate
to the top - My lyrics are skeletons - Accelerate and leave you panicin'
Take the ground from beneath your feet, leave you Skywalk-in' like Anakin
I'm sharper than the tips of Zulu spears and Olympic javelins
My style is totally buck wild and most definitely happenin'
To your brains I be tappin' in, to computers I be hackin' in
To me, I be out of this world like aliens who were time travelin'
I'm babblin' in the Fists of Fury technique when I speak
Forget Karate Kid and these wooden blocks, I chop from concrete
Concrete, concrete, concrete!
Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha!

I been stoned; ever since the days of creation, I've been red
I'm a mad dred, causin' so much havoc in Russel's head
My lyricism is just like an aneurysm inside his brain
He plays the beat in a trance and he's never feeling no pain
I could never be a racist because I posess so many faces
I'm one of those beat-up bad wit' bags and a pair of braces
with lines longer than laces - I'm gracin' you with my presence
The lyrics went flippin', makin' ya bubble like effervescence
I pulverize and bamboozle, shake numb skulls like a boodle
I smashed the top of your head with a guitar I borrowed from Noodle
I'm as animated as Japanese animes causin' callamities
Some serious savory from my roarous rhymes of reality
At the speed of sound, I'm wanderin' around - The clown done tried to defeat us
without tenacities or audacity - Don't you ever thought you could beat us
Beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us, beat us"
24,Cloud of Unknowing ,"On the cloud of unknowing
My world seems open
Every satellite up here is watching
But I was here from the very start
Trying to find a way to your heart

All the days are forgetting
They've gone out with the tide
Lost at sea somewhere, waiting
Like setting suns at the rodeo
Trying to find someone you'll never know

Oh, sinking love
On the cloud of unknowing
Every satellite up here is wanting
Waiting to see what the morning brings
May bring sunshine on it's wings"

To grow a made-up paradise

And its sadness, I consumed (Forever cult)
Into my formats everyday (Forever cult)
In the end, I had to pay (What world is this?)
In the end, I had to pay (I purged my soul)
In the end, I had to pay (I drank to riot)
Nothing more to say (I drank to riot)

By the collective from the grave (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
It only came out at night (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
It ate up their paradise (Paradise)
Where the truth was auto-tuned (Forever Cult)
And its sadness, I consumed (Forever Cult)
Into my formats everyday (Forever Cult)
In the end, I had to pay (What world is this?)
Out there on my silver lake (I was not there)
In the end, it will be great (Beneath the hills)
I'm like a ship between the tides (I saw myself)
I held on, I survived (There in the void)

26,Crashing Down ,"What if the whole world
Is crashing down through space?
Sinking through water
Down to the promised place

Into the searchlights
The shadow's cross the bay
Property pistols
You know we're never here

What if the whole world
Is crashing down in flames?
Falling through oceans
Down to the promised place

Stars shining brightly
A glow in the dark sphere
If green man ask you
We were never here

Why is the whole world
Crashing down through space?
Crashing down through space?
Crashing down through space?"
27,Crystalised ,"You’ve applied the pressure
To have me crystallized
And you’ve got the faith
That I could bring paradise

I’ll forgive and forget
Before I’m paralyzed
Do I have to keep up the pace
To keep you satisfied



(Ahh ahh ahh) (x4)

You don’t move slow
And taking steps in my direction
The sound resounds, echo
Does it lessen your affection
No
(Ahh ahh ahh)(x 2)

You say I’m foolish
For pushing this aside
But burn down our home
I won’t leave alive

Glaciers have melted to the sea
I wish the tide would take me over
I’ve been down on my knees
And you just keep on getting closer

29,Dead Butterflies ft. Kano & Roxani Arias ,"(Mike WiLL Made-It)
Oh, when was I supposed to
Bow down with you? (Yeah)
What, can I be faithful?
There's nothing in this fire
(Can we, can we just loop that last piano part a little bit?)
(EarDrummers)
(Is there a lighter?)
Bow down with you
What can I be praying for?
There's nothing in this fire

Oh, when was I supposed to (Get up, get up)
Bow down with you? (Bow down now, bow)
What can I be praying for? (Praying for, praying for)
If no one in this world, like you? (Like you, like you)

We're dead butterflies (Butterflies, butterflies)
Laid out on a sprung floor
Waited for a long time
To pick us up and fly (Fly, fly)
We're dеad butterflies

I'm all in, let mе know what you're thinkin'
Catch feels, wind down while we figure this out, right now (Right now, right now)
Deja que fluya pa' no perder el control
No queda de otra vamo' a tar en lo mismo
Estoy dispuesta a darte todo el cariño (Todo el cariño)

Two-steppin' while I move reckless
New sentence moves and news pendin'
Loose evidence and news trendin', effortlessly truth bendin'
Who's treacherous, searching for the feelings of a new friendship
There's but a few endings, everyone's a winner 'til you lose brethren
Old time when we use to owe time
Never take to Most High, them fuck up the old skyline
Bright lights, I hope that feeling can replenish
Regretful, 'cause if I let you left me then I'd be russ-rouletting
Got a whole full clip and pow, catch me and grip it now
But memories, lift me up, but still a man's tears dripping down
Onto these photographs of what we used to be
But overtime the puddles turns into a sea
Hoping to myself you cry a stream
I was just surfing on your grief
The hurt I can't believe, just come to terms of who was me
But who are we? These mirrors don't reflect perfection
Just put on your crep selection, come on two steps to Heaven with me

We're dead butterflies (Butterflies, butterflies)
Laid out on a sprung floor
Waited for a long time
To pick us up and fly (Fly, fly)

'Cause if it's not me then
Who's it gonna be, baby?
If it's not us (Not us, not us)
There's nothing in this world for me

We're dead butterflies
Dancing on a sprung floor now
Waited for a long time
To pick us up and fly (Fly, fly)
We're dead butterflies

When was I supposed to (Get up, get up)
Bow down with you? (Bow down, bow down now)
What can I be praying for? (Praying for, Praying for)
If no one in this world, like you? (Like you, like you)

We're dead butterflies (Butterflies, butterflies)"

I like the future (I can do a lot of things nobody else can)
But it's really hard to get there (protect your head or you'll end up dead)
I think I'll wear a space suit (I can do a lot of things nobody else can)
And don't forget your seatbelt (protect your head or you'll end up dead)
Life is meant for living, if I do it again I'll do it with you
Sometimes it feels like I ain't met you, it feels like it's déjà vu (Déjà Vu)
Like we were made for each other, I don't mind my love in too
Baby we are perfectly imperfect, but that's what makes it you (I like)

My brain's creserted (I can do a lot of things nobody else can)
That means I'm lost in the desert (protect your head or you'll end up dead)

Psyonically bionically forget how you feel
Especially formulated the rest of you fornicated
It takes more to make this

Unparreled propulsion to carry the load

Musical merlin he shines like sterling
Watch the Automator draw laser of a higher intensity
And instantly miss a beat create a symphony

Hey I know now, I know now repeat

To let you do that yet you don't want me back 
Before it fall down, falling down falling down 
Falling out to go far from the sun

In these demon days are so cold inside 
so hard for a good soul to survive 
You can't even trust the air you breathe 
Because Mother Earth wants as all to leave 
When lies become reality 
You drown yourself with drugs and TV
Lift yourself up it's a brand new day 
So turn yourself round 
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself 
Turn yourself around in the sun

Strike and I'm thunder with lightning fast reflexes
On constant alert from the constant hurt
That seems limitless with no dropping pressure
Seems like everybody's out to test ya
'Til they see you brake
They can't conceal the hate that consumes you
I'm the reason why you flipped your Isuzu

Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a ninety days digit
And I'm filled with guilt
From things that I've seen
Your water's from a bottle
Mine's from a canteen
At night I hear the shots
Ring so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life
It seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert
With my street sweeper
The war is over
So said the speaker with the flight suit on
Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance
Man, all I want to do is dance

I need a gun to keep myself from harm"

They got locks on the gate 
Don't go over the edge 
You'll make a big mistake 

Put me in a cab to suburbia 
I just took a line but I wasn't with you 
There was more of it there 
When I got back home 
But you had left me 
You don't know my soul

But it's true, you do, nothin' is left, so I guess I'm right

New word: Onomateopoeia (Boom)
Quit actin' like you don't wanna be here
Fuck around and get jumped like leap year
Glock and a glove make you really wanna leave me a...
...lone, get the fuck on, go'n
Okay, okay, okay, back to the happy songs
Rap ain't nothin' but an auto-talkin' kit
My girl look pretty up there ridin' dick
My plaid past, my solid future
Astronaut ass and a gorgeous coochie
I'm an outcast, but you're into me
Summer got mad 'cause winter blew me
That Juicy Fruit, that splooshie-sploosh
Generation X on bloop-de-bloop
Get duked out, or get dookie-duked
Er'rybody hit the floor, we through the roof
Like a chimney, now come in me
How come it be, some lame, man
Nigga talkin' 'bout ""Aww, he don't rap enough""
But y'all rap a lot and I'm like ""Wrap it up, hoe""
Ye ain't Scarface, ye ain't Willie D
Ye ain't Bushwick, ye ain't killin' me
Better play with ya ma'fuckin' mama
Betcha still stay witcha ma'fuckin' mama
Keep sleepin' on me, I'ma rock my pajamas
In the daytime, I swear, I promise
Dare a nigga say somethin', tear a nigga face off
How come blacks don't play baseball?
Y'all white, know y'all can taste all this fly shit
I stay finna take off

Do ya damn thing, do ya thing-a-thing
Do ya damn thing, do ya thing-a-thing
Do ya damn thing, do ya thing-a-thing
Ye ain't fresh squeezed juice, nigga, you that Tang

Do ya damn thing, do ya thing-a-thing
Do ya damn thing, do ya thing-a-thing
Do ya damn thing, do ya thing-a-thing
Well, is you really Slick Rick? Nope, you just ain't a thing

Bet it up, head erupts
A lava language and a vocal volcanic
If it ain't fixed, don't broke it, don't panic
If it ain't this, it ain't shit, goddammit
If it ain't this, it ain't dope, it don't flush
And if it ain't hip or don't hop, well then hush
""Man, they sound like,"" ""Man, they stole yo',""
""Man, they look like"": Nope, it ain't us

Ah, do ya damn thing, do ya thing-a-thing
Do ya damn thing, do ya thing-a-thing
Do ya damn thing, do ya thing-a-thing
Is you really Slick Rick? No, you just ain't a thing

Do ya damn thing, do ya thing-a-thing

Every time we try, we get nowhere
Wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people, yeah?
Tryin' so hard to act like we don't care (I 'on't care)
But it's true, you do, nothin' is left, so I guess I'm right

Flip the page, our days are revelations
Space is strange, doctor, I've got no patience!
Oh, it's all a part of the process (Okay, okay)
Nothin's new, it's true, cool, I admit, shit, I guess you're right!"

The sun has come again too hold you
Sailing out the doldrums of the week
The polyphonic prairies here, it's all around you
It's all around you, out here

And if the whole world is crashing down
Fall through space out of mind again
Where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
Blows all the shadows far away

The falling alcohol empire, is here to hold you
Rooling out and haunted till it sinks

Little memories, marching on
Your little feet, working the machine
Will it spin? will it sore?
My little dream, working the machine

Soothe like a wave
and crash far
Closing in on the moon
And who we are

Little memories
Your little feet, working the machine
Will it spin? will it sore?

Soothe like a wave

Closing in on the moon

But God only knows 
It's hetting hard to see the sun coming through 
I love you... 
But what are we going to do? 

Picture, I'm a dreamer
I'll take you deeper 
Down to the sleepy glow 
Time is a low.. 
Don't you know?

All this sick and selfless days
All it does is fall in
I want to see you 
I love you...

48,Fire coming out of the Monkey's head ,"Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain 
There was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived 
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world 
Obscured as it was by great clouds 

Here they played out their peaceful lives 
Innocent of the litany of excess and violence 
That was growing in the world below 
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough 
Then one day Strangefolk arrived in the town 
They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses 
But no one noticed them: they only saw shadows 
You see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were Blind. 

Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes 
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home 
Jump back from behind them and shoot them in the head 
Now everybody dancing the dance of the dead 
The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead 

In time, Strangefolk found their way into the high reaches Of the mountain 
And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable Sincerity and Beauty 
By chance, they stumbled upon the Place Where All Good Souls Come to Rest 
The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves Above all things 
And soon they began to mine the mountain 
Its rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world 
Meanwhile, down in the town 
The Happyfolk slept restlessly their dreams invaded by Shadowy figures digging away at their souls 
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain 
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives 
And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the Mountain, holes began to appear 
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the Very soul of them up 
For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful for 
They knew that soon the Monkey would soon stir from its Deep sleep 
And then came a sound, distant first 
It grew into castrophany so immense it could be heard far Away in space 
There were no screams 
There was no time 
The mountain called Monkey had spoken 
There was only fire 
And then, nothing 

Oh little town in U.S.A, your time has come to see 
There's nothing you believe you want 
But where were you when it all came down on me 
Did you call me now? "
49,Fire Flies ,"If you see me floatin' too many times
My face will be painted in these white brick lines

'Cause all my fear's invading
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
Livin' on the limits

And if you say goodbye too many times
The sentinels will find me and switch me off this time

'Cause all my fear's invading
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
Livin' on the limits

If all you ever get from the sonnet is the count of the fall of man
Every calling cost made to your heart
You were in the kind of game that put the force in me
I was ever chasing fireflies

Sometimes I follow a firefly
It takes me into the night
Baby, I just survive
I got drunk, I'm sorry
Am I losing you?
Sometimes I follow a firefly
It takes me into the night
Baby, I just survive
I got drunk, I'm sorry
Am I losing you?

If all you ever get from the sonnet is the count of the fall of man

Big man talkin' shit 'til we pin him down (Pin him down)
Big man talkin' shit 'til we lick him down (Until I lick him down)

52,Garage Palace ,"Oh, Palace Flows
Rain falls from the heavens
To my palace rooftop
When the light shines through it
I feel more exposed
Will it ever change here?
We'll just never know
Stimulation I'm in need of
See the time is of the essence
And this clock doesn't own a home
Rain falls from the heavens
To my palace rooftop
When the light shines through
I feel more exposed

[Verse 1: Little Simz]

In tune
By myself
On it, my mind is my weakness
Wear your strength, you might surprise yourself
Never deny yourself
I live in the space is my thesis
I know you need this
I know you need this
I'm prone to run out of pieces
That might connect to something bigger
All in your mind, could follow me
You should consider
Look at the time, I'm probably later than ever
What did you find?
Well come in here, and lit them with pressure
I look to the heavens and I saw open gates
I walked up and then I pause
What the fuck did you do this for?
Wish me luck when that midnight falls
Memories of a past life
Can this be this is our time?
Can this be this is our time?
Come on

[Verse 2: Little Simz]

In stillness
Known to the world, do you feel this?
Trapped in my mind
Hope I can find solitude
I'm connecting all of these pieces
I know you need this
I know you need this
I'm folding, unleash the beast
Unknown is what I would be
If my whole purpose here wasn't to speak
Now look at the time
I know that I'm early today
What did you find?
You giving up or running away?
I gazed to the stars
And this view can't be shared
There are no other eyes in this room
Mean the words when you sing your tune
Free as a bird when I intake fumes
Memories of this past life
Can it be this is our time?
Can it be this is our time?
Come on"

You're coming on to me, just
We're going to religion
Like water, we're moving baby
And we're running through life's cycles
This is the ego shaking
We need to escalate it
We're only halfway to the lover waiting

[Refrain: Peven Everett &Choir]
Halfway, halfway to the halfway house
We're not takers

[Verse 2: Peven Everett]
We're feeling the same chill
It's giving momentum
We're feeling the same thrill
Whatever we do, trust
Imagine a broadcast, the central in mountain
You say that you want your cherryade fountain

[Chorus: Peven Everett & Choir]
Cherry (Cherry)
Cherryade fountain
I found mercy (I found mercy)
I found mercy (I found mercy)

[Bridge: Peven Everett & Choir]
Play piano, I'll sing mercy
Cherry-ch-ch-ch-cherry, baby
Cherry, cherryade fountain
I found mercy (I found mercy)
I found mercy (I found mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy)
Swim in the light!
(Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy)
Gotta get out!
(Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy)

[Chorus (Variation): Peven Everett & Choir]
Cherry (Cherry)
Cherryade fountain
(Cherryade fountain)
I found mercy (I found mercy)
I found, I found
I found mercy (I found mercy)
I found, I found, I found, I found mercy baby
I found

I found mercy (I found mercy)
I found, I found

57,Hallelujah Money (feat. Benjamin Clementine) ,"Here is our tree
That primitively grows
And when you go to bed
Scarecrows from the far east
Come to eat
Its tender fruits
And I thought the best way to perfect our tree
Is by building walls
Walls like unicorns
In full glory
And galore
And even stronger
Than the walls of Jericho
But glad then my friend
Out in the field we shall reap a better day
What we have always dreamt of having
Are now for the starving
It is love, that is the root of all evil
But not our tree
And thank you my friend
For trusting me

Hallelujah

Hallelujah money
(Past the chemtrails)
Hallelujah money
(Hallelujah money)
Hallelujah money

Hmmm
Hallelujah money
(Hallelujah)
Hallelujah money
(Oooh)

How will we know?
When the morning comes
We are still human
How will we know?
How will we dream?
How will we love?
How will we know?

Don't worry, my friend
If this be the end, then so shall it be
Until we say so, nothing will move
Ah, don't worry
It's not against our morals
It's legal tender
Touch, my friend
While the whole world
And whole beasts of nations desire
Power

When the morning comes
We are still human
How will we know?
How will we dream?
How will we love?
How will we know?

Guts to the brain 
It means you got it coming and you ain't got a change
Their only attire 
Is a typical vice 
But if it gets you well, well you ain't being nice, no 
No! 

So follow the lights
Till they cut up your eyes 
You won't be even seeing if you ain't growing lies 
Then bought all the shit 
That should never be sold 
They put a gun above it and a narrow behold 

We are the happy landfill

So, I'm building above and back

When I get it all from you,
I'm gonna get it all, true, true

It's so cold and I say goodbye
People holding a meaning, why?
But you never let the car get in
For holding on the sound of swim

Did you want a wind and a sail
It would take a boat
All of the wind and roud
Say what you want don't bring 
anything back to me

Cause I'm old and I will say goodbay
Hoping to run out of our own life
If I get a lot from you
I'll make it all come true"

You don't have to be a start,
To, to get them going round

Even if you try to move,
Wheel it to your right,
So get on, on the driving wheel,
Save it for a round,

Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly Man now

Got a ride in my heart
See I'm going down
Cut up by the ball front,
Shoot a jamboree,
Just a cold lighted day,
Like a memory,
Just a cold lighted day,
Slip a line on me,

Little did they know, no sweat
So I dimmed out, rimmed out and cracked the glass
Twenty-five pounds, can you match that bag?
Cause if you not, raise up
I got a deal to make
And couple of bad bitches I've been making a break
Wake it and bake
I put the cake on the plate
Jealousy and me? Oh, we're making the day
Don't vibe with this, Hollywood, nigga won't survive this shit
I do that, did that, blow your fuckin' wig back
Forreal-a, gorilla, who loves goin' [?]
They wanna eye me down, tie me down, lock me up
But I'm a lion in the dog pound
Now, how that sound?

Junk boats and English boys
Crashing out in supermarts
Electric fences and guns

You swallow me
I'm a pill on your tongue
Here on the nineteenth floor
The neon lights make me calm

And late in a star's life
It begins to explode
And all the people in a dream
Wait for the machine
To pick the shit up, leave it clean

Kid, hang over here
What you're learning in school
Is the rise of an eastern sun
Gonna be good for everyone?

Music turned into thin air
The DJ was the last to leave
She had well-conditioned hair
Was beautiful but nothing really was there"

Silver linings getting lost

Floated out into the woods
To hear the old elk call
Touched a rainbow with my hands
I'm dry, I got 'em all
""Ride on,"" said the king of cool
You've got nothing to lose
Tinsel town is down the road
It's the bullet of the noose

No need to be sad, when they play your song, we'll get along

[Verse 1: AJ Tracey & 2D]
I been searchin', lookin' for a permanent reason
Out of sync with the seasons, not sure what I believe in
And a burden, why is bein' loved so appealin'?
Can confirm I'm alone, we're all just lost without meanin' (Jimmy Jimmy)
Just a boy from the West, I'm born and bred
We coulda been rich, was poor instead
My evenings are blue, all my mornings are red
I had to make scores from gents (Jimmy Jimmy)
I salute all my local fiends
They're smilin', locked in a smoker's dream
Kept an ace like a poker team (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Just a teen sellin' coke to fiends (Jimmy Jimmy)
I took remedy, young ones I love
Got the money, I got stuck inside of my mind
Quick solutions was all I could find
I was earnin' but losin' my time (Jimmy Jimmy)
Portobello, I'm sippin' on wine
With a beautiful Nottin' Hill mother of five
Mental muscle, the strong will survive
That's why I drink white rum on the Manchester Drive

Hate the front so I sat in the back
With a girl from Iran with the peachiest back (Jimmy Jimmy)
Love me a spliff, but I gotta keep it a stack
The females around me are crack
Got me wired, I ain't comin' back to reality
I bleed it out in the track (Jimmy Jimmy)
Did some things that I swear I won't tell
I called that I could get redemption from Hell
Love and hate are like Kenan and Kel
I broke up my kis, now my friends in the cell (Jimmy Jimmy)
Life is for livin', I love me some shillings
But God willin', people love me for my skillin'
Went from sittin' in gold and [?]

If I get back then I'll be grateful
Look there's a billboard on the moon

Let me take you this far
This crossing isn't much to me
There's lightning in the storm clouds
And I'll send you there to stay

You got me lost in Magic City
You got me questioning it all
I hope that I make it home by Wednesday
And this Magic City lets me go

We could do so much better than this
Oh, Rita, oh, Rita

[Segue: 2D]
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid

[Verse 1: slowthai & 2D]
Your potential, you lack credentials
And you are special, so fucking special (Rita)
Oh, how you need it, oh, how you're needed
And you keep squeezing the truth from the middle (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
You parted seas, but your arches, they ain't golden (Ah)
And you was gangin' for some gags and now you're rollin' (Woo)
Best you shut your trap and keep it hush (Hush)
On another note, compliments make me blush
There's a hole in your pocket, so you cannot find the change
Cavern of your mind, you say your pattern
You pull your strings and you jump, hold your mouth and you say: (Ah, ah, ah)
""What was scripted, the day before it happened?""
We all give applause when people look and pause
But on the way out and get your back in
See, everything in life ain't silver and gold
But minin' for metal gave you platinum

[Refrain: slowthai]
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's weird, a thing to think light bulb don't blink
Just flickers to them, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
Makes me sick

[Bridge: 2D]
Poster boy (Ayy)
Poster girl (Rita)
Truth, the bills (The bills)
Must be paid (Yeah, yeah, alright)
Poster boy (Yeah, alright)
Poster girl (Ah, that's time)

[Verse 2: 2D]
The truth, the bills, they must be paid (Uh-huh)
And what is left and sorta atypical
All you need to change your face
You're gettin' sold, it's such a waste
You know, we could do so much better than this
Swimmin' in pools of momentary bliss
Where you gotta find a family 'cause everybody taken
They worry you keep on adding
I think you gotta crawl

[Refrain: slowthai]
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's weird, a thing to think light bulb don't blink
Just flickers to them, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's weird, a thing to think light bulbs don't blink
Just flickers to them, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
Makes me sick

We could do so much better than this
Oh, Rita, oh, Rita"

De La is also back again
With a crew that's bound to pack them in
Got a girl who's up for the mating
I sense the need in her grammar
Her nose has never been skating
But she's sippin' star constellation
Her real squirt game was so like 2Pac at a court run towards camera
Her response to that was just ""Check please""
Fuck that my man you can't let these (moments)
Pass you by like ""tick tock""

Made her alarm ring

And now we done, we passed the test
And now lay down to rest

Moved to the spot, I'm one of a few
A whole lot of everything, but nothin' to do
Tilted in a Tesla, pardon the ex-wrestler

Girls trip, Miami at the end of the year
Polluted-filled skies, trying to think clear

Woulda floated bloated 
Voted sugar coated 
Loaded hip shooter 
Draw for the poor 
Free coffee at the banks 
Hit through the straw 
None more for me, thanks 
That blanks the raw 
That dang sure stank lit 
Sank passed the pit for more hardcore prank spit 
Crank it on blast 
Roll past front street 
Blew the whole spot 
Like some old ass with skunk meat 
These kids is too fast 
Juiced off a junk treat 
Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?

My guess is yes you can like, can I kick it? wicked 
Liquor shot 
If u happy and u know it 
As you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flow it 
Broke a pen and i'm in cope hymen 
Dope or rhymin all worth it then 
The hope diamond 
Required off the blackmarket 
Or wire tappin 
Couldn't target a jar of spit 
The rapid fire spark lit 
Zzzzt! 
A rapper bug zapper 
And it don't matter after if they's a thug or a dapper. 
Plug yer trap or it's maximum exposure 
The beast got family in numbers asking 'em for closure 
Aw, send 'em a gun an tell em clean it 
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it 
She wore a filled-in thong 
A billabong 
And said, nah, fo'realla 
The Villain on a Gorilla jawn?

Suppose you 
Down when you're in fast

It feels like you're with your father in the place you love...

There's the great, shining whole
And everyday I look out of the bus
The silver linings in the dust

Caught up in wetter country; the cooler of the year

Ride on me with heavy winds when leaves are turning red
I will come to fetch you in the morning in your bed

103,Oil feat. Stevie Nicks ,"Then I put my codes in the machine
But the world I found was made of faulty dreams (Of faulty dreams)
I was on my own there in the psychic silence
I was looking out for some other kite to
Fly out of the doldrums and recall the log
From the early database of your love

Fairy light companions
To the dark maths that catapult
Us into imagined worlds
Seems a mockery remote

Interlocking cluster bombs
Like drum and bass, I thought
Close the wells of poison
Fill them up with love

I was on my own there
I was all alone
I got lost, intangible
But that's the place you reach when
You can't help yourself anymore
And the madness come
You'll be falling into the bass and drum (Bass and drum)

Fairy light companions
To the dark maths that catapult
Us into imagined worlds
Seems a mockery remote

'Cause I got no choice in it
And I'm not so cold
I could look you in the eye
And not recall (And not recall)

Don't think that my heart is a sad affair without you
Individual actions change the world
Fill them up with love"
104,On melancholy hill ,"Up on melancholy hill
There's a plastic tree
Are you here with me?
Just looking out on the day
Of another dream

Well you can't get what you want
But you can get me
So let's set up and see
'Cause you are my medicine
When you're close to me
When you're close to me

So call in the submarine
'round the world we'll go
Does anybody know
If we're looking out on the day
Of another dream

If you can't get what you want
Then you come with me

Sits a manatee
Just looking out for the day
When you're close to me

Deep in the summer day
I'll be there with you
(That's where I heard it for myself)
On the training ground
For the new world
You heard it too"
106,Opium feat. Earthgang ,"[Verse 1: Johnny Venus]
I've been cooped up for a minute
I've been inside working on me
Hyperbolic chamber I sit
I'm gon' dance my way out of this
Winter lasted for ages
Trouble don't last always
Brand new life, turn the page
Be alright, be okay

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Grinding, loving, singing, hugging, living, get it, stack it
Run it, dancing, flying, people, wake up
Come on, keep on, dreaming, don't stop
Loving, trying, growing, don't stop
They gon' try to slow you, don't stop
Never, ever, know I, don't stop
London, Paris, L.A., don't stop

[Verse 2: Johnny Venus]
Atlanta, Jamaica, Rio, don't stop
New York, Lagos, Sydney, don't stop
You tried to kill me, created a monster
You tried to end me, but fate said ""No, no""
Know why they envy, I got it, it's in me
Been so long since I had new faith
Been so long since I changed my ways
Been so long since I been okay
I met a lady on the side of the road
And her eyes were a story that had never been told
About a life that was lived on hope
And the truth of the inner light that we all hold
She said ""Baby, I can hear my train coming
I'll leave with something before I go
Listen child, don't you ever waste time tryna dim nobody shine
Better water your own""

 [Verse 3: 2D]
Will we wake up tomorrow?
I feel like we are closer together
Sing for colossal changes
And how we treat each other when we're living in a city of elevations
Is it man or woman feeling some balance today?

[Bridge: 2D]
Hope
Hope the radiant light is shining on you (shining on you)
Hope
Hope the radiant light is shining on you

[Chorus: Johnny Venus]
Grinding, loving, singing, hugging, living, get it, stack it
Run it, dancing, flying, people, wake up
Come on, keep on, dreaming, don't stop
Loving, trying, growing, don't stop
They gon' try to slow you, don't stop
Never, ever, know I, don't stop
London, Paris, L.A., don't stop

[Verse 4: Doctur Dot]
Been a long time since I been outside
Don't let it catch up with me
I contact just with me
Tapped in, wrapped up
Bring it in, let me in
Let me all over in between
Leave a toothbrush in your dreams
I ain't worried 'bout the next thing
I'll be with you to the extreme
Ice bounce off the glow of the moonlight
I hope we're still close when the sunrise
I paint the picture clear for ya
I can't hold this in much longer
Searching for this feeling my whole life 


[Bridge: 2D]
Hope
Hope the radiant light is shining on you (shining on you)
Hope
Hope the radiant light is shining on you"
107,"Out of Body (feat. Imani Vonshà, Zebra Katz & Kilo Kish) ","[Intro: Kilo Kish]
Pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down
We're here tonight for a very special offering
An offering of our spirits this evening in unison
But first a word of instruction

[Verse 1: Kilo Kish]
Hello, hello
Please leave all your belongings at the door
You can sit or stand, we can take a vote
And just tiptoe to the center of the circle
While we unveil the ropes
Still a little room left to hang your clothes
Some of us are new here, we'll take it slow
Ready, set, go
I lock hands with yours
We dive into the floor
When we reach the core
Then we stomp some more
I lock hands with yours
And then we dive down into the floor
Seven thousand miles 'till we reach the core
And then we circle back and we stomp some more
Got it?
It's just like that
You promise all your life, then you turn your back
You glide across the space, and diagonal past
Then you kick, and you jump, and you arch your back
You move your hips and your arms like a cat
Spin three times, and you're back where you're at
Does anybody catch what any of this is about?
No? Well, work it out

[Hook: Zebra Katz]
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright

[Verse 2: Kilo Kish]
Okay
Slide like a lizard, bark with the crowd
Eyes dilated, dark to the grass
Then when you find you're invisible
You melt into a puzzle
Keep it flowing like the rivers do
You gotta pay attention to the motion of the fish
Stay within the school or you're surely gonna miss
And if you lose your way, it's a cold black abyss
Don't take the chance, not worth the risk

[Hook: Zebra Katz]
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright
Out of body from morning to night
Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright

[Interlude: Kilo Kish]
Who knows?
There's always stains on what's real and true
Tonight is a special, special occasion
And all that's left for us to do, is move

[Bridge: Imani Vonshà]
Ooh, I, I
Where am I going?
What am I doing?
I, I'm alive
Alive
I cannot follow
I, I'm so alive
I'm so, I'm so high

[Verse 3: 2-D (Zebra Katz)]
(Everybody)
Everybody says I'm busted and blue
I feel better when I don't need that
Everybody gonna [?]
(It's so big, big, big)
Everybody says that I'm more
Feelin' out of body, I'm drinkin' it up
Can I tell you what the dream's about tonight?
(Dance low, pat, and I'm feeling alright)"
108,PAC,"Alrighty
Let's go
Uh, ah

You can freak me out, you can throw me in the lion pit
You can boil my hands and tell me I'm not here
I'm a mad Pac-Man, livin' in a leveled world
Everywhere I go I don't know where I am

You can call me cracked, you can call me glad and cyborg
You can load my head, and sail me into bathing light
Everybody knows, when I was sad, I fell for you
Everywhere I go, no stressin' out, no stressin' out
No stressin' out, no stressin' out, stressin' out

You can hide your head, you can throw me in the lion pit
You can boil my days and tell me I'm not blue
Everybody knows, when I was sad, I fell for you
Everywhere I go, I don't know where I am

I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out
I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out
I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out
I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out
I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out
I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out
I'm stressin' out, I'm stressin' out
I'm stressin' out

Uh, how can I trust truth?
Uh, when I ain't got nothin' to sell
I shattered my thoughts to get out my shell
Uh, why would I hold my tongue to tuck in my tails?
Ayy, can't dream if my ego is broke
The jokes that try to find the answer to nope
My type of drive, you can't buy this shit
You got a heart but it don't beat like this
I had a spark, then my mind went trip
Create the wave so the vibe all mix

(I'm a mad Pac-Man) 
(Livin' in a leveled world)

Yo, I been at the top of the top
Fell from the ceiling before I fail
'Cause I needed to grow, Bruce Lee, royal with the glow
Uh, walked on the edge, fuck tryna dream in the bed
'Fore I die on these meds, niggas gon' die on the feds
'Fore I make it to jail, prolly put one in the head
Fuck the judge and the prosecutor for hangin' me dead
Plus thirty and still movin', I'm close to the live, right?
Close to the live, right?
All the trauma from past never taught me to fear heights
Normal to fly now, can't be stuck in the red lights
Take flight, the life gon' bloom for the Black Knight
Keep a piece, no Buddhist, got the whole hood boomin'
I'm like a Crip how I stewed it, you on your ass, stuck, stupid
You makin' we look bad, I rock the beat, won't crash
I had to fill my bag, I had to hide my stash
You know the cops' lights flash, I had to clear my dash
I represent my flag, I gave the hood my last
Every full-grown limit, I had to change my image
The brain don't got limits, you think a mill' mean winnin'
Pigs out here skinnin', your soul ain't authentic
You died and still ain't livin'"

Watching ships go by

It's sort of made a computer speech (2x)
It's a Casio on a plastic beach

If they hold you, whale
On a really hot day
When the call got made
You've gone away

113,Possession Island feat. Beck ,"[2D:]
I stand and look out on the dark plain
Where the moon is rising
And the hydrofoils are coming back in
From the past in silence

Where things they don't exist
And we're all in this together 'til the end

[2D & Beck:]
Where the pearly gates remain open
And welcome me home
Cause the time I came to California, I died
At the hands of the coasting queen

Where things they don't exist
And we're all in this together 'til the end
'Til the end
Evermore

[2D (Beck):]
Should I ask you? (Should I ask you?)
For forgiveness? (Forgiveness?)

[2D & Beck:]
And open my heart?
If I say these words will you listen
Or leave me here in the dark

Where things they don't exist
And we're all in this together 'til the end
'Til the end

Where things they don't exist
And we're all in this together 'til the end
'Til the end"
114,Punk ,"Bound to myself and goes home
Making of herself a number
Always tell her before I start up
Do now what I tell you shut up

Bound to the chair
Do me what you can
Bound to a door
Get down on the floor
Find out how we'll do with the loop
'Til everybody says shut up
Yeah

Telling to Miguel I love her
Try and see what happens get up
Everybody says I should up
Last time I told them right off

Playing with the sun
I knew what I was doing
Did it to myself
Did it to myself
I let horror to myself of doing
'Cause everybody tell me shut up"

Algo siemre te entristese
Cuando todo va bien
Que pasa contigo?

Dejalo si quieres continuar

Tienes una vida preciosa
De que sirve si solo 
Mueres suavemente

117,Revolving Doors ,"Revolving doors, what have I done
Someone on the TV, a tap-in lowse
Revolving doors, what will I become
A redneck song

He paid up for seven
but he only got an eight now
I feel that I'm paused by all the pills
I see no wrong in it

On a foggy day

(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston
Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)

I sit in a diner
And the Beatles play
I paid up for a seven
But I only got eight oh now

(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston
Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)

I feel that I'm paused by all the pills
I seem to run out here

Revolving doors
It's stormy on the eastern seaboard
He got silver up this night

He paid up for three
But got only two

(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston

Seems I was born to this
Revolving doors

118,Rhinestone Eyes ,"I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
Where the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines till they weep
With future pixels in factories far away
So call the mainland from the beach
Your heart is now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

I can't see you now my heart is frozen
All the bowses and the growses
Have been abstinated in my soul
I prayed on the immovable
Yet clinging to the atoms of rock
Seasons see adjustment signs of change
I can't see now, she said, ""Taxi""
Now that light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

(Here we go again)
That's electric
(Uh)
That's electric

Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time every day, same routine
A clear target in the summer when skies are blue
It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Nature's corrupted in factories far away

(Here we go again)
That's electric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (uh)
That's electric
With future pixels in factories far away
(Here we go again)
That's electric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (uh)
That's electric
With future pixels in factories far away

All hours we chillin' and max the flow
Relaxing
Opposites attracting

Floss when the track spin
Like I'm on a crack binge
Jigging and wiggling
Freakin' booties speakin' to the cuties so belligerent
No religion just bump the feed on
You'll feel reborn
Negativity we just dead it like decoy
Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
The pulse when it respawns

Severed head

[Verse 1: GoldLink & 2D]
I've been losing everything, yeah
I can't keep a fucking thing, yeah
Do the money, do the fame
It seems like that controls this thing
Guess my head just left the building
Like out the window, missed the ceiling
I cannot explain this feeling
I never learned to speak Brazilian
Now I'm stuck, my body left me bleedin' (severed head)
Roll the train, it's passing fast
It's speeding outside
My body gone, don't need the soul, ey
Just take another breathe or so, ey
Found on my torso
I mean my neck go, but where did my heart go?
I mean, my leg go, but where did my mind go?
I guess I only gotta go where the body goes
Geronimo (Stay a little longer)

[Verse 2: 2D]
Paradise has mountains that take a lifetime
To climb in dreams, I fly above them
I'm haunted by what I saw last night
On angelic highways, waiting in the darkness
I'm on a speeding train (severed head)
I stick my head out of the carriage window (severed head)
My cheeks inflate, my eyes become watery (severed head)
Whoosh, my head is severed (severed head)
Will you stay a little longer?

Condensation makes pathways down a window pane (severed head)
I don't really wanna watch you drive away
What do you say?
Maybe you could stay for another day
Oh, baby, wait
What exactly did the doctor say?
I've been grinding teeth awake in bed
And my aching head
How could love suddenly be dead?
We could swallow bread
Our hunger is not easily fed
I've been waiting for sleep to come
I've been breathing through these aching lungs
I keep waking up
This is worse than ever breaking up
If your time is up
How much more before mine is up?

Yeah, uh (severed head)
The roundabout, the vibe is nice
We all will die
Yeah, I mean the roundabout (severed head)

If I could take her down and run, then I'd call her
'Cause she's standing drama, she knows I'll call her
She's getting on the sun and then she order
Imagine me, imagine me now (she's my collar)
I don't take her number, just don't think I'd call her
I take her down to somewhere drab and naughty
Clear my system, I don't need no other

Just something, you should feel nada
I know she lies alone, she's my caller
I sense her in my mind, she's my collar

She's the serpentine, she's my collar
I send a message, never call her
And now I wanna taste another

She's the one that gets my collar
She's the one I'm running with

How I got caught up in nowhere again (oh)

128,Simplicity ft. Joan As Police Woman ,"[Intro: Joan As Police Woman]
It's starting to pour
Why don't we get out and then dance on the pavement?
Abandon your wars
The sky and thunder and lightning and rain are innocent
It's tipping down, I can't see
But I'm not really caring 'cause I'm dancing on the pavement
Oh say, can you see?
The sky and thunder and lightning and heavens open for us

[Chorus: 2D]
Shut in, don't know, no no, to be shut in
Don't know, not meant, to be shut in
Don't know, camera, sinking, now, come, you're alive, oh
It's taking me out (Simplicity)

[Verse: 2D]
Night time and I go smooth some off
(Little bit of news)
Negative, now it's red and I
Chime in strong
(Little bit of news)
Are you ever really lost?
You cutting cardboard
Watchers waiting, we had names
We had suspects, but a boxset caught your eye
And I was forgotten, I was forgotten
I am the architect of this delusion
The burgeoning load, one billion
These are amazing times
The past is a place where rockets take off
What now, a burnished plaque
[Chorus: 2D]
Shut in, don't know, no no, to be shut in
Don't know, not meant, to be shut in
Don't know, camera, sinking, now, come, you're a loss

Gone, gone, gone
I was gone

I'm back, where are we goin'?
Seem to get tired of the mornin' dawn
With a bass sittin' on my head
I'm missin' all that I used to know, then
I get the kids to school, and I get
Up(x3) on with certain dread
And when I see the kissing down below
Easy life, I get right

I take my pills and I get in the mood and I
Take five to get it to load in
Even in the place
And I get my jeans on right
And sit in the rows and
Inside I live in a cage and I
Peek out and summon the code and I
Enter the lake to face what I'm cagin'

Gone with the self of the day, gone

Its pollution only turns you into something you don't want To see in the water 
A reflection of them that you receive 

You don't own the sun 
And the sun won't shine again 
So maybe you're all in love 
With Aluminium 

The cling and a clang 
Is the metal in my head when I walk 
I hear a sort of, this tinging noise 
Cling clang 
The cling clang 
So many things happen while walking 
The metal in my head clangs and clings as I walk 
Freaks my balance out 
So the natural thought 
Is just clogged up 
Totally clogged up 
So we need to unplug these dams 
And make the the natural flow 
It sort of freaks me out 
We need to unplug the dams 
You cannot stop the natural flow of thought 
With a cling and a clang 

And wake me up again until 
We're Aluminium 
You hold it in your hands 
The sun will shine again 
The sun will shine again 
The sun will shine again 
The sun will shine again

Spin around in black and white
Spinnin' around until the Sun comes up
Strange time to see the light

I think I've fallen onto silken thread, my head is spinning
Suspended in a twilight web that keeps on giving
The looping dervish in the lodge is lost within the ringing
Far away I can hear the sound of someone out there singin'
I'm speeding through the forest, strange echoes of Belarus
where presidents pin badges on disconnected youth
What would you be dreaming of?
No horse play, no diving
Cutting grass with scissors, whilst the great leaders reclining
In golden hallways where we spin
The faithful will be silent

[2D]
Existing or not?
At the same time, spinning

[Robert Smith & (2D)]
Spinnin' around the world at night (Strange times)
Spin in and out of sight
Spinnin' around until the Sun comes up (I helped you feel good)
Strange time to turn it on

Spinning around the world at night
Spin around in black and white
Spinning around until the Sun comes up
Strange time to see the light

Bottled water world, surgical glove world, beach washing world
I'm twitching in the grimy heat, I think I might be spinning
The unicorn degrading
No horse play, no diving
Cuttin' grass with scissors, whilst the great leaders-

It's more than I can take

Then you walk away

Opponents tryna checkmate
But I don't see no escape
Just tryna keep my head straight
On thin ice with the ice skates
At times, I feel like giving up
'Cause it feels like I've had enough
Felt like my soul in handcuffs
Got questions with no answers
Can't help me out, I need a friend
I'm losing faith in this world of sin
Tryna make ends meet with a week, no sleep
It's like a cycle that never ends
I can't pretend with no handling
I can't take care of no grown man
All by myself, crying out for help
But won't get saved by no Superman
All comes down to the mighty dollar
Greed and lust, abusing power
Clock is ticking, hour after hour
Maybe when I throw my hands, I'll holla

When you state your love
But you run away
What could you be on?
Now you're not around

Look, it comes with a toy hehe, I like that.
I wanna number 4, a number 6, and throw in a plastic doughnut
Just enjoy the gritty crunch, it tastes just like chicken.
Wrappers of many bite sizes
Man, are you freakin blind? That's a rock.
All mixed in the pot for momma's homemade from scratch, well, not quite.
Toasted over flames, they be tasting quite right.

All hail king Neptune and his water breathers
No snail thing to quick for his water feeders 
Don't waste time with your net, our net worth is Set Ready, go. 
Many know others, but 
We be the colors of the mad and the wicked
We be bad, we be brickit with the 24 hour sign
Shower my habits while you dine like rabbits
With the crunchy, crunchy carrots (that's chicken)
Gotta have it Superfast!

(A whole lot of breakfast you got time for!)

Superfast Superfast, I come in last, but just in time for breakfast
Keep it through, Keep it through, forever blue 

Tonight's the night for ??
Aluminum I crush your fun aluminum
The sea is radioactive 
The sea is radioactive

146,Tarantula ,"I think the sadness has come again
Green velvet in a passing den
No bloodiness, no gold earring
Right outside for you

Nothing will be bad for me then too
I just want to put my arms 'round you
And whisper
I'm on one percent but I'm there with you

I know I fantasise
Although I don't even mind
If you're good for me
Then I'm good for you
And that's all I need
In my life

Through polymer dunes I dance tonight
With you frozen under mirrored lights
No ways out, only ways in
To my heart
As the calling seems to grow again
It's a problem that I can't remend
Always with you
Always

I know I fantasise
Although I don't even mind
If you're good for me
Then I'm good for you
And that's all I need
In my life

Time's run out (In my life)
Nowhere real (In my life)
In the hills (In my life)
What I feel (On my own, on my own, on my own)
On my own
(Even) Time run out
I need you

Only ways in to my heart
Need you, I need you, I need you, I need you

If you're good for me
Then I'm good for you
And that's all I need
In my life

I know I fantasise
Although I don't even mind
If you're good for me
Then I'm good for you
And that's all I need
In my life

Time's run out (In my life) (Need you)
Nowhere real (In my life)
In the hills (In my life)
Is what I feel (In my life, in my life, in my life, in my life)
(Need you, I need you, I need you, I need you)
On my own
Time run out (If you're good for me, then I'm good for you)
I need you (And that's all I need in my life)"

Texas can you hear me?
Speed up on the dawn.
To the pains and blues of Houston,
in the sun.


Where home is a bus
in the parish of space-dust.
Where the mountains die.
And today is golden."
151,The Pink Phantom ft. Elton John & 6LACK ,"You've more or less forgotten me this summer
I can't hide my disappointment
I was on my way in the phantom fire;
the one you gave away

Try to tell you that I love you but I'm choked up
You forgot and that makes me feel like no one (Some times)
Were you even really there? Did you ever really care?
Wait, I got so many examples of all of the good times we had
Long summer nights (Summer nights), held you long time
Put your name in my rhyme, refresh your memory
of where you want to be, the phantom's on the way
She's comin' down the street

I tried to get to Atlanta
on a peach blossom highway
I'm tryin' to put these pauses out of mind
In a sky made of diamonds
where the world fell silent
I'll be waiting for you on the other side

Summer lights (Everyday, everyday)
Sometimes (Ride where the summer goes)
Summer nights
Every night
Summer nights

I tried to say I love you
but you didn't listen (Sometimes)
Tried to give you everything you might need (Summer nights)
In a sky made of diamonds
And where the world is flawless
I'll be waiting for you on the outside

Summer lights, summer lights
Hold it in for a long time
Summer lights, seems to me I'm in a dream
Oh, these summer lights

The phantom is coming
You forgot and that makes me feel like no one
She’s crossing over the line
Wait, I got so many examples of all of the good times we had
Seems to me I’m in a dream (Long summer nights, held you long time
Put your name in my rhyme, refresh your memory)
And I have these summer nights (of where you want to be, the phantom's on the way
She’s comin' down the street)
Sometimes"
152,The sounder ,"
You couldn't escape this music even if your name's Houdini 
Our tracks say Lah for Life and don't disappear like a Genie 
Communicating through your airwaves like a giant C.B. 
'Cause this one's for your radios or whether you recieve me 
Our music is so hot, it feels like the sun in Tahiti 
We rickety-rock, Gorillaz style is buck wild, believe me 
We heavyweights who phase ya like Ali did with Frasier 
We spit the most flava but musically, we'll amaze ya 
We've been blessed and we've been gifted like Jesus in his Manger 
Won't you shout 'Hallelujah!' Here comes your music saviour 
From your heart to your mind, your spirits to your souls, 
we've come to take control with the Gorillaz on patrol 
See, our rhymes possess the powers of a superhero 
Supernaturally we rock the mic but wit' a natural flow 
If you didn't know before, you know now - We told you so 
Gorillaz rock your dome just like the one in Tokyo 

It's a hard dream to contemplate 
I could fall into the abyss-ah 
And I love this interlude 
It's the reason to deliver 
And they called onto me 
Says they came to talk to me though 
The more of us that lies, 
I guess the kids don't live or die 

'Cause we're makin' this music that's making you lose it 
So people don't abuse it and there ain't no way for you to Refuse it 
Gorillaz be the army that's startin' this pardy-ardy 
Makin' more noise than carnivals mixed with the Mardi-Gradi 
We're comin' through your town with the sound that's so Profound 
Gorillaz with the rappers that straight from the Underground 
We're tearin' it down, makin' you feel this sort of force 
Knockin' you to your senses and knockin' you off your Course 
'Cause we're the source, got you feeling that's so Appealing 
We got you jumpin' around and bouncin' off of the ceiling 
Makin' music ya feeling from Baltimore into Bristol 
I know you're hearin' me 'cause my voice is clearer than Crystal 
The casual, supernatural flows I be exposin', 
Makin' sure that you're frozen and makin' sure that I'm Chosen 
To rip a score, makin' you damage the dance floor 
Gorillaz and Phi Life'll give you what you ask for 

It's a hard dream to contemplate 
I could fall into the abyss-ah 
And I love this interlude 
It's the reason to deliver 
And they called onto me 
Says they came to talk to me though 
The more of us that lies, 
I guess the kids don't live or die 

Let Gorillaz be your guiding light and your shining star, 
Whether you be home alone or drivin' in your car 
Don't matter who ya are, whether you be near or far, 
You'll be feelin' entertained be our music repertoire 
See, our poems, they be flowin' like rivers and resevoirs 
'Cause Gorllaz, we be out of this world like men of Mars 
We rap stars with supernatural spars 
We leave your brains amazed with this super music of ours 
So put your hands up and stand up - It's time to get down 
'Cause Gorillaz and Phi Life, we be breakin' you 'round 
From the right to the left, from the skies to the ground 
We're coverin' all angles and you can't escape the sound 
On the track, it's laid back - We've come to spray raps 
Keep it chilled and relaxed but we still sound phat 
It's like that when we write raps 
We're not from the Empire but we still Strike Back!

I won't get over the dam

Check I'll hold you 
I wish it was you 
Gotta get a cat up a CK 
Cause that's where we're at 
Gotta give a car the beetles 
Cause they're just sad 

But I won't get over it now 
Cause it's half-drawn on the shout

I gotta shit out like I was never 
On the fallest town to be 
I could wish this way forever

Wanna grow to keep it in June 
Gonna make it easy for you 
Wanna be the carever in the coal 
Just get this on with 
Everything the kids enjoy 

But I won't get over it soon 
Cause there ain't light at full noon 
Cause at four o' clock in the morning 
I got cheering up to do 
If not, you get a real shot 
It's just like walls I never drived

Catch sunrise and the freeway glows
Perfumed with Palo Santo

I'll always keep you close beside me

I hear that a lot up in the hills
Logic kills on Silver Lake reflections
Just trying to keep my head up
But nothing real anymore
In the world of the tired influencer
Ain't sleeping deep
Waiting for an answer
Gotta press on, brown eyes
I always keep you close beside me

156,The Valley of the Pagans ft. Beck ,"Welcome to the land of the permanent sun
Where the flowers are melted and the future is fun
The freeway lizards are all feelin' so good
From a one-way trip back to West Hollywood, let's go

It feels so good to have a perfect song
It feels so good to be in total control
It feels so good to have a perfect song
It feels so good to be in total control

There were spotlights flying through the sky
From a winter wonderland, catching out
The beasts hiding in the grounds, no future, Batman
Long before Christmas, not very likely
One hundred million Viagra tablets
Starving away... in a valley 

It feels so good to have a perfect song (uh-huh)
It feels so good to be in total control (uh-huh)
It feels so good to have a perfect song (uh-huh)
It feels so good to be in total control (uh-huh)

It's so convincing, but something's missing
The sun is kissing my face and erasing my doubts
I'm going out with a bang, and the fangs of a parasite
I'm feeling alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

Say ""Sweet dreams"", etc. & ""Forever,
I hope"", said no one

She's a plastic Cleopatra on a throne of ice
She's a haemophiliac with a dying battery life
Candy-colored fingers and schadenfreude eyes
Thinkin' airbrushed thoughts with a logo on her mind

It's so delightful, it's so insightful
It's so frightful, and I'm feeling it
Every single fucking day-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay
It's time to party
It's time to party (whoo!)

In the valley where you wake up every beautiful day
And the world you created in your image is golden
Valley made of mirrors, oh, the light is so bright
You can feel like a Pagan, you can feel like a Pagan
In the valley where you wake up every beautiful day
And the world you created in your image is golden
Valley made of mirrors, oh, the light is so bright
You can feel like a Pagan, you can feel like a Pagan

In the valley (valley)
In the valley (valley)
In the valley (valley)
In the valley (valley)
Feel like a Pagan now
Feel like a Pagan
In the valley (valley)

I'm looking for a saw to cut these chains in half

And all I want is someone to rely on
As thunder comes a rolling down
Someone to rely on
As lightning comes a staring in again

I'll wait to be forgiven
Maybe I never will
My star has left me
To take the bitter pill

That shattered feeling
Well, the cause of, it's a lesson learned
Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again
Just don't know if I could do it all again
She said, ""It's true""

Waiting in my room and I lock the door
I watch the colored animals across the floor
And I'm looking from a distance
And I'm listening to the whispers

And oh, it ain't the same 
When you're falling out of feeling
And you're falling in and caught again
Caught again

I'm caught again in the mystery
You're by my side, but are you still with me?
The answer's somwhere deep in it
I'm sorry but you are feeling it

But I just have to tell you
That I love you so much these days
Have to tell you
That I love you so much these days, it's true

My heart is in economy

Yeah yeah yeah I'll pay 
When tomorrow 
Tomorrow comes today"
160,Tormenta feat. Bad Bunny ,"[Chorus: 2-D & Bad Bunny]
The sun in the storm (Sun in the storm; someone cryin')
Someone cryin' (Someone, someone, someone, someone)
Something is said (Someone cryin')
Someone cryin' (Someone, someone, someone, someone)
Ey, ey

[Refrain: Bad Bunny]
Y aprovéchame hoy, que mañana me voy
Y no sé cuándo vuelvo si en tus ojo' me pierdo
Y aprovéchame hoy, que mañana me voy
Y no sé cuándo vuelvo si en tus ojo' me pierdo

[Verse 1: Bad Bunny]
Y nadie lo pidió (Pidió), pero estamo' aquí (Aquí)
Yo no sé si fue Dio', ey, pero creo que lo vi, -i
Cuando me besaste
No sé cuando llegaste, pero no quiero que te vaya'
Tú hace' contraste
Con todo este desastre que me toca vivir
Eh, eh, eh, eh-eh, eh
La cura del miedo la tiene' tú
Veo todo claro aunque se fue la lu', ey

[Refrain: Bad Bunny]
Aprovéchame hoy
Ey, ey

[Verse 2: Bad Bunny]
Y yo no quiero ver el mundo arder
Pero algo tan bonito, no, no se puede perder
El reloj nos quiere morder
Pero en tus brazo' me voy a esconder, ey
Pa' que no me encuentren (Encuentren)
To' el mundo siempre está pendiente (-diente)
Pero no saben lo que se siente (Siente)
Cruza conmigo ante' que se rompa el puente (Puente), je
Y que se joda el resto
¿Quién dice lo que está correcto?
Si el amor nunca ha sido perfecto
Ojalá sea por siempre este momento
Pero si no


[Chorus: 2-D]
The sun in the storm (Sun in the storm; someone cryin')
Someone cryin' (Someone, someone, someone, someone)
Something is said (Someone cryin')
Someone cryin' (Someone, someone, someone, someone)
Something is—

[Instrumental]

[Outro: 2-D]
The sun in the storm (Sun in the storm; someone cryin')
Someone cryin' (Someone, someone, someone, someone, someone, someone, someone, someone)"
161,Tranz ,"Oscillate yourself tonight
When you're in your bed
Assimilate the dopamine
Passing through your head

When you get back on a Saturday night
And the room is caving in
Do you look like me? Do you feel like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this forever?

See yourself with cupid's flame
Chipped in your head
Pay them a lie, the satellites
Passing by the edge

When you get back on a Saturday night
And your head is caving in
Do you look like me? Do you feel like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this forever?
Do you dance like this forever?

Do you look like me
Do you burn like me (x3)

Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this forever?
Do you dance like this forever?

Do you dance? (x4)"
162,We Got the Power ,"We've got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens, we've got the power to do that
On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?
We've got the power to be
Ringing the great bell out there above us
We've got the power for that
We got the power to do that

They dream of home
I dream of life out of here
Their dreams are small
My dreams don't know fear
(I got all you)
I got my heart full of hope
I will change everything
No matter what I'm told
Or how impossible it seems
(We got the power)
We did it before
And we'll do it again
We're indestructible
Even when we're tired
And we've been here before
Just you and I
Don't try to rescue me
I don't need to be rescued

We've got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens, we've got the power to do that
On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?
We've got the power to be
Ringing the great bell out there above us
We've got the power for that
We got the power to do that

Get yourself up to the silent altar
And call me
But don't forget the machines
'Cause if your choice is chipping it down on the M1 (1, 1, 1)
Then you'll wake up in the morning
You'll be storming, oh, oh, oh

We've got the power to be loving each other
No matter what happens, we've got the power to do that
On a le pouvoir de s'aimer, okay?
We've got the power to be
Ringing the great bell out there above us
We've got the power to do that
We got the power, power, power-pow-power
We got the power

We got the power"
163,Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach (feat. Snoop Dogg)  ,"Gorillaz and the boss Dogg
Planet of the Apes

The revolution will be televised
And the pollution from the ocean
Now with devotion
Push peace and keep it in motion

Kids,gather around
Yeah, I need your focus
I know it seem like the world is so hopeless
It's like wonderland

Now fascinate me, picture and animate me
'Cause I'm rolling, deep holing
Click clacking,crack-a-lacking
Full packing, mo'stacking

Actic a fool when I teach
Welcome to the world of the plastic beach
Welcome to the world of the plastic beach

Mirror,mirror on the wall
Boss Dogg, give it to 'em get involved
Turn it up, speed it up, slow it up,
Underground where the under us undercut

Shipped up, shipped out
Swimming with the sharks
With my gills up, turn the wheels up, real tough
Drinking lemonade in the shade, getting blade with  gang of
pilgrims

Yeah,this my path
Belly flopping, locking while I'm rocking on the bubble bath
And I'm just like math,four zeros added up,that get you more cash
So quick,so fast all the kids say they love it when I make 'em 
laugh

Welcome to the world of the plastic beach
Welcome to the world of the plastic beach
Welcome to the world of the plastic beach
Welcome to the world of the plastic beach
Welcome to the world of the plastic beach"
164,White flag ,"Hey, look, yo!

No castaway, no survivor
I ain't lost and this ain't shipwrecked
I feel small in this big wide world
And mommy ain't said, 'Honey, I shrunk the kids' yet'

I ain't Jesus but I'm walking on water
There's no bums here, there's no wall 'cause
I can break out of jail with a lighter
So is there any point in making laws blood?

This ain't Atlantis, are you sure?
I nearly suffocated when I touched the shore
No rain, condoms get poured
And up the road, you'll never guess who I saw

It's K.A. look, skip on the beat like Ali in the gym
Honey, I'm home, this is where I wanna live
Disbanded like leave, oh
On the d-low.

I don;t know if it's greener but it's green though
On the other side of the fence, bind to the ends
Look,no fence, no stress, no rent, no supervision shit, this real flow
Where the women look hot but the beach cold

And the speech goes like, ""Hi little lady
Sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby""
Word in the village, I'm a little bit crazy
Swag up on a hundred degrees, no eighty

Look, if heaven had a VIP
This is it, white sand, blue sea
But I don't know who they are
And I'm damn sure they don't know me
But I come in peace

Cool,white flag,white flag

No war,no guns
No corps, just life

Just love,no hate
Just fun, no ties

Just me and my mind
Just me and my wife

But tell me if I'm dreaming
'Couse I don't wanna wake up till the evening
And I don't wanna be left sleeping
From all the diseases that I breathe in

Look,respect the island, no stealing
And don't bring religion here, no three kings
It's great and we ain't leaving
We come on in peace, sing

White flag,white flag"

Hahaha

[Verse 1: Moonchild Sanelly]
Where I'm from they said I live on a cloud
Simply 'cause I just dreamt too much
Black sheep but I am all blue now
It's the start but I've done blew up
I haven't done none, yeah, the travel's tough
Light white sands and the waves too far
They said, ""No"", I said, ""That's too tough""
Went to Google bombed their systems down
