0,In The Flesh?,"



(We came in)

So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow

Tell me is something eluding you sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?

If you want to find out what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise


"
1,The Thin Ice,"



Momma loves her baby
And Daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you, babe
And the sky may look blue

Ooh, babe
Ooh, baby blue
Ooh, babe

If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear-stained eyes

Don't be surprised,
When a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice


"
2,Another Brick In The Wall (Part I),"



Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snap shot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me?

Daddy what d'ya leave behind for me?

All in all it was just a brick in the wall
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall


"
3,The Happiest Days Of Our Lives,"



You! Yes, you! Stand still, laddy!

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who
Would hurt the children any way they could

By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids

But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night,
Their fat and psychopathic wives
Would thrash them within inches of their lives


"
4,Another Brick In The Wall (Part II),"



We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave them kids alone

Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone

All in all it's just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

[Chorus by pupils from the Fourth Form Music Class Islington Green School, London]

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone

Hey, teacher, leave us kids alone

All in all you're just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

[Spoken:]
Wrong! Do it again!
Wrong! Do it again!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?!
You! Yes, you, behind the bike sheds, stand still, laddy!


"
5,Mother,"



Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooh, aah, mother, should I build the wall?

Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Ooh, aah, is it just a waste of time?

Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mama's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mama's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mama's gonna keep you right here under her wing
She won't let you fly but she might let you sing
Mama's gonna keep baby cozy and warm

Ooh, babe, ooh, babe, ooh, babe
Of course mama's gonna help build the wall

Mother, do you think she's good enough for me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous to me?
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Ooh, aah, mother, will she break my heart?

Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mama's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mama won't let anyone dirty get through
Mama's gonna wait up 'til you get in
Mama will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean

Ooh, babe, ooh, babe, ooh, babe
You'll always be a baby to me

Mother, did it need to be so high?


"
6,Goodbye Blue Sky,"



[A child's voice:]
Look, Mummy. There's an airplane up in the sky.

Did, did, did, did you see the frightened ones?
Did, did, did, did you hear the falling bombs?
Did, did, did, did you ever wonder
Why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?

Did, did, did, did you see the frightened ones?
Did, did, did, did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone
But the pain lingers on

Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye


"
7,Empty Spaces,"



[backwards message:]
Hello, Luka [hunters]... Congratulations. You have just discovered the secret message. Please send your answer to Old Pink, care of the Funny Farm, Chalfont...
Roger! Carolyne's on the phone!
Okay

What shall we use
To fill the empty spaces
Where we used to talk?
How shall I fill
The final places?
How should I complete the wall


"
8,Young Lust,"



I am just a new boy 
A stranger in this town 
Where are all the good times 
Who's gonna show this stranger around? 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl 
Will some woman in this desert land 
Make me feel like a real man 
Take this rock and roll refugee 
Oooh babe set me free 

Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl. 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl.

[Spoken:]
Hello?
Yes, a collect call for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd will you accept the charges from United States?
Oh, he hung up!
That's your residence, right?
I wonder why he hung up?
Is there supposed to be someone else there besides your wife there to answer?
Hello?
This is United States calling, are we reaching-
See he keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering


"
9,One Of My Turns,"



""Oh my God! What a fabulous room! Are all these your guitars?""
[Film in background:] (""I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to startle you!"")
""God! This place is bigger than our apartment!""
(""Let me know when you're entering a room."")
(""Yes, sir!"")
""Uh, can I get a drink of water?""
(""I was wondering about dinner, sir.)
""You want some, huh?""
(""Yes?"")
(""When do you and your guests want to dine? I have to inform the kitchen staff."")
""Oh wow, look at this tub? Wanna take a bath?""
(""Yes, I'm aware of your duties Dobbs."")
(""Yes, sir."")
(I'll have to find out from Mrs. Bancroft what time she wants to eat. As for her maid, needless to say, she can have her meal with the kitchen help.)
""What are you watching?""
(""Very good, sir. If you'll just let me know as soon as you can when you and Mrs Bancroft want to eat."")
(""Mrs. Bancroft will be dining alone."")
""Hello?""
(""Why? I don't understand, sir."")
(""I won't be staying for dinner."")
""Are you feeling okay?...""
(""I'm surprised to hear that, sir, since you just arrived."")
(""Yes, I'm a little surprised about it myself."")

Day after day, love turns grey
Like the skin of a dying man
Night after night, we pretend it's all right
But I have grown older and
You have grown colder
And nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade
Tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum

Run to the bedroom
In the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favourite axe
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase
One of my bad days
Would you like to watch T.V.?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly?
Would you?
Would you like to see me try?

Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?


"
10,Don't Leave Me Now,"



Ooh babe
Don't leave me now

Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends

Ooh babe
Don't leave me now

How could you go
When you know how I need you?

To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night

Ooh babe
Don't leave me now

How can you treat me this way
Running away

Ooh babe
Why are you running away?
Ooh babe!


"
11,Another Brick In The Wall (Part III),"



I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all

No, don't think I'll need anything at all

All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall


"
12,Goodbye Cruel World,"



Goodbye cruel world
I'm leaving you today
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Goodbye all you people
There's nothing you can say
To make me change my mind
Goodbye.


"
13,Hey You,"



Hey, you!
Out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old.
Can you feel me?

Hey, you!
Standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles.
Can you feel me?

Hey, you!
Don't help them to bury the light.
Don't give in without a fight.

Hey, you!
Out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone.
Would you touch me?

Hey, you!
With your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out.
Would you touch me?

Hey, you!
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

But it was only fantasy.
The wall was too high as you can see.
No matter how he tried he could not break free.
And the worms ate into his brain.

Hey, you!
Out there on the road,
Always doing what you're told.
Can you help me?

Hey, you!
Out there beyond the wall,
Breaking bottles in the hall.
Can you help me?

Hey, you!
Don't tell me there's no hope at all.
Together we stand,
Divided we fall.


"
14,Is There Anybody Out There?,"



Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?


"
15,Nobody Home,"



I've got a little black book with my poems in
I've got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in

I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues.
I got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from

I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
Got amazing powers of observation

And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There'll be nobody home

I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt

I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains

I've got wild staring eyes
I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to

Ooh, babe, when I pick up the phone
There's still nobody home

I've got a pair of Gohills boots
But I've got fading roots.


"
16,Vera,"



Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn?
Remember how she said that we would meet again
Some sunny day?

Vera! Vera!
What has become of you?
Does anybody else in here feel the way I do?


"
17,Bring The Boys Back Home,"



Bring the boys back home
Bring the boys back home
Don't leave the children on their own, no, no
Bring the boys back home

(""Wrong, do it again!"")
([*knock*] ""Time to go!"")
(""Are you feeling okay?"")
(""He keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering!"")
([*laughter*])

Is there anybody out there?


"
18,Comfortably Numb,"



Hello
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?

Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again

Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

O.K.
Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb


"
19,The Show Must Go On,"



Ooh Ma Ooh Pa
Must the show go on?

Ooh Pa take me home
Ooh Ma let me go

There must be some mistake
I didn't mean to let them take away my soul
Am I too old? Is it too late?

Ooh Ma Ooh Pa
Where has the feeling gone?
Ooh Ma Ooh Pa
Will I remember the songs?
Ooh ah the show must go on.


"
20,In The Flesh,"



So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow

I got some bad news for you sunshine
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you fans really stand

Are there any queers in the theatre tonight?
Get 'em up against the wall (against the wall)
Now there's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall (against the...)

And that one looks Jewish and that one's a coon
Who let all this riff-raff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint and another with spots
If I had my way I'd have all of ya shot


"
21,Run Like Hell,"



Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

You better make your face up with your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile and your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter down your door
You better run!

Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

You better run all day and run all night
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight
You better park the car well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box
You better run!


"
22,Waiting For The Worms,"



Eins, zwei, drei, alle

Ooh-ooh, you cannot reach me now
Ooh-ooh, no matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
Walk on by

Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come (worms to come)

In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come

Waiting to cut out the deadwood
Waiting to clean up the city
Waiting to follow the worms

Waiting to put on a black shirt
Waiting to weed out the weaklings
Waiting to smash in their windows and kick in their doors

Waiting for the final solution to strengthen the strain
Waiting to follow the worms

Waiting to turn on the showers and fire the ovens
Waiting for the queens and the coons and the reds and the Jews
Waiting to follow the worms

Would you like to see Britannia rule again
My friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms

Would you like to send our coloured cousins home again
My friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms


"
23,Stop,"



Stop
I wanna go home
Take off this uniform
And leave the show
And I'm waiting in this cell
Because I have to know
Have I been guilty all this time


"
24,The Trial,"



[Prosecutor:]
Good morning, the Worm your honour
The crown will plainly show
The prisoner who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do

Call the schoolmaster!

[Teacher:]
I always said he'd come to no good
In the end, your honour
If they'd let me have my way
I could have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder
Let me hammer him today

[Pink:]
Crazy
Toys in the attic,
I am crazy
Truly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away

[Choir:]
Crazy
Toys in the attic
He is crazy

[Wife:]
You little shit, you're in it now
I hope they throw away the key
You should've talked to me more often than you did,
But no, you had to go your own way.
Have you broken any homes up lately?

""Just five minutes, Worm your honour, him and me alone""

[Mother:]
Babe
Come to mother, baby, let me hold you in my arms
M'Lord I never wanted him to get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm your honour, let me take him home

[Pink:]
Crazy
Over the rainbow
I am crazy
Bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in

[Choir:]
Crazy
Over the rainbow
He is crazy

[Worm:]
The evidence before the court is incontrovertible.
There's no need for the jury to retire.
In all my years of judging
I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving the full penalty of law.
The way you made them sufferâ
Your exquisite wife and motherâ
Fills me with the urge to defecate
(Go on, judge. Shit on him.)
Since, my friend, you have revealed
Your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers.

Tear down the wall

[Choir:]
Tear down the wall [repeat]


"
25,Outside The Wall,"



All alone or in twos
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down outside the wall

Some hand in hand
And some gathered together in bands
The bleeding hearts and the artists make their stand

And when they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy
Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall

Isn't this where we...
