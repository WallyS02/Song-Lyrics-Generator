Tell me true. Tell me why
Was Jesus crucified?
Was it for this that daddy died?

Was it you? Was it me?
Did I watch too much T.V.?
Is that a hint of accusation in your eyes?

If it wasn't for the Nips
Being so good at building ships
The yards would still be open on the Clyde.

And it can't be much fun for them
Beneath the rising sun
With all their kids committing suicide

What have we done?
Maggie, what have we done?
What have we done to England?

Should we shout? Should we scream?
What happened to the post-war dream?
Oh, Maggie, Maggie, what did we do?


"
1,Your Possible Pasts,"



They flutter behind you your possible pasts
Some bright-eyed and crazy some frightened and lost
A warning to anyone still in command
Of their possible future to take care
In derelict sidings the poppies entwine
With cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time

Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?

She stood in the doorway the ghost of a smile
Haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign
Her cold eyes imploring the men in their macs
For the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs
Stepping up boldly one put out his hand
He said, ""I was just a child then. Now I'm only a man.""

Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?

By the cold and religious we were taken in hand
Shown how to feel good and told to feel bad
Tongue tied and terrified we learned how to pray
Now our feelings run deep and cold as the clay
And strung out behind us the banners and flags
Of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags

Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?


"
2,One Of The Few,"



when you're one of the few to land on your feet
what do you do to make ends meet?
teach
make them mad, make them sad, make them add two and two
make them me, make them you, make them do what you want them to
make them laugh, make them cry, make them lie down and die


"
3,The Hero's Return,"



Jesus, Jesus, what's it all about?
Trying to clout these little ingrates into shape
When I was their age all the lights went out
There was no time to whine and mope about

And even now part of me flies
Over Dresden at angels one five
Though they'll never fathom it behind my sarcasm
Desperate memories lie

Sweetheart, sweetheart, are you fast asleep? Good
That's the only time that I can really speak to you
And there is something that I've locked away
A memory that is too painful to withstand the light of day

When we came back from the war
The banners and flags hung on everyone's door
We danced and we sang in the street
And the church bells rang

But burning in my heart
The memory smoulders on
Of the gunners dying words
On the intercom


"
4,The Gunner's Dream,"



Floating down through the clouds
Memories come rushing up to meet me now
But in the space between the heavens
And in the corner of some foreign field

I had a dream
I had a dream

Goodbye Max
Goodbye ma
After the service when you're walking slowly to the car
And the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air
You hear the tolling bell
And touch the silk in your lapel
And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band
You take her frail hand
And hold on to the dream

A place to stay
Enough to eat
Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street
Where you can speak out loud
About your doubts and fears
And what's more no-one ever disappears
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door
You can relax on both sides of the tracks
And maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
And everyone has recourse to the law

And no one kills the children anymore
No one kills the children anymore

Night after night
Going round and round my brain
His dream is driving me insane

In the corner of some foreign field
The gunner sleeps tonight
What's done is done
We cannot just write off his final scene
Take heed of the dream
Take heed


"
5,Paranoid Eyes,"



Button your lip and don't let the shield slip
Take a fresh grip on your bulletproof mask
And if they try to break down your disguise with their questions
You can hide, hide, hide
Behind paranoid eyes

You put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar
Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar
Laughing too loud at the rest of the world
With the boys in the crowd
You can hide, hide, hide
(""I'll tell you what, I'll give you three blacks, and play you for five"")
Behind petrified eyes

(""Ta! You was unlucky there, son"")
You believed in their stories of fame, fortune, and glory
Now you're lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age
The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high
And you hide, hide, hide
(""Time gentleman!"")
Behind brown and mild eyes

""Oi!""


"
6,Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert,"



brezhnev took afghanistan
begin took beirut
galtieri took the union jack
and maggie over lunch one day
took a cruiser with all hands
apparently to make him give it back


"
7,The Fletcher Memorial Home,"



take all your overgrown infants away somewhere
and build them a home a little place of their own
the fletcher memorial
home for incurable tyrants and kings
and they can appear to themselves every day
on closed circuit t.v.
to make sure they're still real
it's the only connection they feel
""ladies and gentlemen, please welcome reagan and haig
mr. begin and friend mrs. thatcher and paisley
mr. brezhnev and party
the ghost of mccarthy
the memories of nixon
and now adding colour a group of anonymous latin
american meat packing glitterati""
did they expect us to treat them with any respect
they can polish their medals and sharpen their
smiles, and amuse themselves playing games for a while
boom boom, bang bang, lie down you're dead
safe in the permanent gaze of a cold glass eye
with their favourite toys
they'll be good girls and boys
in the fletcher memorial home for colonial
wasters of life and limb
is everyone in?
are you having a nice time?
now the final solution can be applied


"
8,Southampton Dock,"



They disembarked in '45
And no one spoke and no one smiled
There were too many spaces in the line

And gathered at the cenotaph
All agreed with hand on heart
To sheath the sacrificial knives

But now
She stands upon
Southampton Dock
With her handkerchief
And her summer frock
Clings to her wet body in the rain

In quiet desperation
Knuckles white upon the slippery reins
She bravely waves the boys goodbye again

And still the dark stain spreads between
Their shoulder blades
A mute reminder
Of the poppy fields and graves
And when the fight was over
We spent what they had made
But in the bottom of our hearts
We felt the final cut


"
9,The Final Cut,"



Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes
I can barely define the shape of this moment in time
And far from flying high in clear blue skies
I'm spiralling down to the hole in the ground where I hide

If you negotiate the minefield in the drive
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes
And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall
Dial the combination, open the priesthole
And if I'm in I'll tell you (what's behind the wall)

(Wahoo!)

There's a kid who had a big hallucination
Making love to girls in magazines
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith
Could anybody love him?
Or is it just a crazy dream?

And if I show you my dark side
Will you still hold me tonight?
And if I open my heart to you
And show you my weak side
What would you do?

Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
Would you take the children away
And leave me alone?
And smile in reassurance
As you whisper down the phone
Would you send me packing?
Or would you take me home?

Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down
I held the blade in trembling hands
Prepared to make it but â just then the phone rang
I never had the nerve to make the final cut


"
10,Not Now John,"



Hey, listen. It's a

Fuck all that we've gotta get on with these
Fuck all that, fuck all that
Gotta compete with the wily Japanese
There's too many home fires burning and not enough trees
Fuck all that
So fuck all that we've gotta get on with these
Gotta get on with these

Can't stop lose job mind gone silicon
Star long what bomb get away pay day make hay
Break down need fix big six
Click click hold on oh no 
Bingo! (Bingo!)

Make em laugh
Make em cry
Make em dance in the aisles
Make em pay
Make em stay
Make em feel OK

Not now John
We've gotta get on with the film show
(gotta get on, gotta get on)
Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow
(End of the rainbow)
Who cares what it's about
As long as the kids go
(As long as the kids go)
So, not now John
We've gotta get on with the show
(gotta get on with the show)
(gotta get on, gotta get on)

(gotta get on, gotta get on)
(gotta get on)

Hang on John
I've gotta get on with this
(gotta get on, gotta get on)
Don't know what it is
But it fits on here like this 
Come at the end of the shift
We'll go and get pissed
But not now John
I've gotta get on with this
(gotta get on with this, gotta get on)

Hold on John
I think there's something good on
I used to read books but 
It could be the news
Or some other amusement
Could be re-usable shows

Fuck all that we've gotta get on with these
Gotta compete with the wily Japanese
(gotta get on, gotta get on)
No need to worry about the Vietnamese
Gotta bring the Russian bear to his knees
(gotta get on)

Well, maybe not the Russian bear
Maybe the Swedes
We showed Argentina, now let's go and show these
(gotta get on, gotta get on)
Make us feel tough and wouldn't Maggie be pleased
Nah nah nah nah nah nah!

One, two, three, four
(Not now John we've gotta get on)

S'cusi dove il bar?
What?
(gotta get on)
Se parakalo pou einai to bar?
(Not now John we've gotta get on)

S'il vous plaÃ®t ou est le bar
(gotta get on, gotta get on)

Oi' where's the fucking bar John!
(Not now John we've gotta get on)
Oh, now you're talking!
Oh! Rule Britannia! Britannia rules the day
(gotta get on, gotta get on)
Down!
(Not now John we've gotta get on)
Go, Maggie!
(gotta get on, gotta get on)
Hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, now!
(Not now John we've gotta get on)
(gotta get on, gotta get on)

11,Two Suns In The Sunset,"



In my rear-view mirror the sun is going down
Sinking behind bridges in the road
I think of all the good things
That we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions
Confirm suspicions
Of the holocaust to come

The rusty wire
That holds the cork
That keeps the anger in
Gives way
And suddenly it's day again

The sun is in the east
Even though the day is done
Two suns in the sunset
Could be the human race is run

Like the moment when the brakes lock
And you slide towards the big truck
Oh, no
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear

And you'll never hear their voices
Daddy, daddy, 
And you'll never see their faces
You have no recourse to the law anymore

And as the windshield melts
And my tears evaporate
Leaving only charcoal to defend
Finally I understand
The feelings of the few
Ashes and diamonds
Foe and friend
We were all equal in the end

""...The head of the US...""
...and now the weather. Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers spreading from the east ... with an expected high of 4000 degrees Celsius.""
