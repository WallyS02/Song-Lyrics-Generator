0,Let There Be More Light,"



Far, far, far, far away, way
People heard him say, say
I will find a way, way
There will come a day, day
Something will be done

Then at last the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall

Now, now, now is the time, time
Time to be, be, be aware

Carter's father saw it there and
Knew the road revealed to him
The living soul of Hereward the Wake

Oh, my, something in my eye, eye
Something in the sky, sky
Waiting there for me

The outer lock rolled slowly back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes was Lucy in the sky

Oh, oh, did you ever know, know
Never ever will they
I can't say

Summoning his cosmic powers
And glowing slightly from his toes
His psychic emanations flowed

1,Remember A Day,"



Remember a day before today
A day when you were young
Free to play along with time
Evening never comes

Sing a song that can't be sung
Without the morning's kiss
Queen you shall be if you wish
Look for your king

Why can't we play today?
Why can't we stay that way?

Climb your favorite apple tree
Try to catch the sun
Hide from your little brother's gun
Dream yourself away

Why can't we reach the sun?
Why can't we blow the years away?

Blow away
Blow away
Remember
Remember

2,Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun,"



Little by little the night turns around
Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning
Under the eaves the swallow is resting

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

Over the mountain watching the watcher
Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine
One inch of love is one inch of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun

Witness the man who raves at the wall
Making the shape of his question to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun

3,Corporal Clegg,"



Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg
He won it in the war, in 1944

Corporal Clegg had a medal too
In orange, red and blue
He found it in the zoo

Dear oh dear, oh were they really sad for me?
Dear oh dear, oh will they really laugh at me?

Missus Clegg, you must be proud of him
Missus Clegg, another drop of gin?

Corporal Clegg, umbrella in the rain
He's never been the same
No one is to blame

Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream
From Her Majesty the Queen
His boots were very clean

Missus Clegg, you must be proud of him
Missus Clegg, another drop of gin?

[Until the end:]
Corporal Clegg

4,See-Saw,"



Marigolds are very much in love
But he doesn't mind
Picking up his sister, he makes his way into the see-saw land
All the way
She smiles
She goes up while he goes down, down

Sits on a stick in the river
Laughter in his sleep
Sister's throwing stones, hoping for a hit
He doesn't know so then
She goes up while he goes down, down

Another time (Ah-ah)
Another day (Ah-ah)
A brother's way to leave (Ah-ah)
Another time (Ah-ah)
Another day (Ah-ah)

She'll be selling plastic flowers
On a Sunday afternoon
Picking up weeds, she hasn't got the time to care
All can see
He's not there
She grows up for another man, and he's down

Another time (Ah-ah)
Another day (Ah-ah)
A brother's way to leave (Ah-ah)
Another time (Ah-ah)
Another day

Another time (Ah-ah)
Another day (Ah-ah)
A brother's way to leave (Ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)


"
5,Jugband Blues,"



It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here
And I'm most obliged to you for making it clear
That I'm not here
And I never knew the moon could be so big
And I never knew the moon could be so blue
And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes
And brought me here instead dressed in red
And I'm wondering who could be writing this song

I don't care if the sun don't shine
And I don't care if nothing is mine
And I don't care if I'm nervous with you
I'll do my loving in the winter

And the sea isn't green
And I love the Queen
And what exactly is a dream?
And what exactly is a joke?
