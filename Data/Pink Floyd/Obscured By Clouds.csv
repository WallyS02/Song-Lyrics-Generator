0,Burning Bridges,"



Bridges burning gladly merging with the shadow
Flickering between the lines
Stolen moments floating softly on the air
Born on wings of fire and climbing higher

Ancient bonds are breaking
Moving on and changing sides
Dreaming of a new day
Cast aside the other way

Magic vision stirring
Kindled by and burning
Flames rise in her eyes

The door that stands ajar
The walls that once were high
Beyond the gilded cage
Beyond the reach of ties
The moment is at hand
She breaks the golden band


"
1,The Gold It's In The...,"



Come on, my friends, let's make for the hills
They say there's gold and I'm looking for thrills
You can get your hands on whatever we find
'Cause I'm only comin' along for the ride

Well, you go your way, I'll go mine
I don't care if we get there on time
Everybody's searching for something, they say
I'll get my kicks on the way

Over the mountains, across the sea
Who knows what may be waiting for me?
I could sail forever to strange sounding names
Faces of people and places don't change

All I have to do is just close my eyes
To see the seagulls wheeling in those far distant skies
All I wanna tell you, all I wanna say
Is count me in on the journey, don't expect me to stay


"
2,Wot's...Uh The Deal?,"



Heaven sent the promised land
Looks alright from where I stand
'Cause I'm the man on the outside looking in

Waiting on the first step
Show me where the key is kept
Point me down the right line because it's time

To let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there's a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I'm growing old

Flash the readies wot's...uh the deal?
Got to make it to the next meal
Try to keep up with the turning of the wheel

Mile after mile (Mile after mile)
Stone after stone (Stone after stone)

Turn to speak but you're alone
Million miles from home you're on your own

So let me in from the cold
Turn my lead into gold
'Cause there's a chill wind blowing in my soul
And I think I'm growing old

Fire bright by candlelight
And her by my side
And if she prefers we never stir again

Someone sent the promised land
And I grabbed it with both hands
Now I'm the man on the inside looking out

Hear me shout 'Come on in. What's the news and where've you been?'
'Cause there's no wind left in my soul
And I've grown old


"
3,Childhood's End,"



You shout in your sleep
Perhaps the price is just too steep
Is your conscience at rest
If once put to the test?
You awake with a start
To just the beating of your heart
Just one man beneath the sky
Just two ears, just two eyes

You set sail across the sea
Of long past thoughts and memories
Childhood's end, your fantasies
Merge with harsh realities
And then as the sail is hoist
You find your eyes are growing moist
And all the fears never voiced
Say you have to make your final choice

Who are you and who am I
To say we know the reason why?
Some are born; some men die
Beneath one infinite sky
There'll be war, there'll be peace
But everything one day will cease
All the iron turned to rust
All the proud men turned to dust
And so all things, time will mend
So this song will end


"
4,Free Four,"



One, two, free, four!

The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You shuffle in gloom of the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die

Life is a short, warm moment
And death is a long, cold rest
You get your chance to try in the twinkling of an eye
Eighty years, with luck, or even less

So all aboard for the American tour
And maybe you'll make it to the top
And mind how you go, and I can tell you, 'cause I know
You may find it hard to get off

You are the angel of death
And I am the dead man's son
And he was buried like a mole in a fox hole
And everyone is still on the run

And who is the master of fox hounds?
And who says the hunt has begun?
And who calls the tune in the courtroom?
And who beats the funeral drum?

The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You shuffle in gloom in the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die


"
5,Stay,"



Stay
And help me to end the day
And if you don't mind
We'll break a bottle of wine

Stick around
And maybe we'll put one down
'Cause I wanna find
What lies behind those eyes

Midnight blue burning gold
A yellow moon is growing cold

I rise
Looking through my morning eyes
Surprised
To find you by my side

Rack my brain
And try to remember your name
To find
The words to tell you goodbye

Morning dues
Newborn day
Midnight blue
Turned to gray

Midnight blue burning gold
A yellow moon is growing cold
