Lime and limpid green
A second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down
The sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan
Stars can frighten

Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam
Pow, pow
Stairway scare
Dan Dare
Who's there?

Lime and limpid green, the sound resounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sound resounds
The icy waters underground


"
1,Lucifer Sam,"



Lucifer Sam, Siam cat
Always sitting by your side
Always by your side
That cat's something I can't explain

Jennifer Gentle you're a witch
You're the left side
He's the right side
Oh, no!
That cat's something I can't explain

Lucifer, go to sea
Be a hip cat, be a ship's cat
Somewhere, anywhere
That cat's something I can't explain

At night prowling sifting sand
Hiding around on the ground
He'll be found when you're around
That cat's something I can't explain


"
2,Matilda Mother,"



There was a king who ruled the land
His Majesty was in command
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showered silver on the people

Oh, Mother
Tell me more

Why'd'ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They're scribbly black and everything shines

Across the stream with wooden shoes
Bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time

Wandering and dreaming
The words had different meaning
Yes, they did

For all the time spent in that room
The doll's house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by

Oh, Mother
Tell me more
Tell me more

Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah


"
3,Flaming,"



Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown

Yippee! You can't see me
But I can you

Lazing in the foggy dew
Sitting on a unicorn

No fair, you can't hear me
But I can you

Watching buttercups cup the light
Sleeping on a dandelion

Too much, I won't touch you
But then I might

Screaming through the starlit sky
Traveling by telephone

Hey, ho, here we go
Ever so high

Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown

Yippee! You can't see me
But I can you


"
4,Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk,"



Doctor, doctor, I'm in bed
Doctor, doctor, aching head
Doctor, doctor, gold is lead
Doctor, doctor, choke on bread
Doctor, doctor, underfed
Doctor, doctor, gold is lead
Doctor, doctor, Jesus bled
Doctor, doctor, pain is red
Doctor, doctor, dark doom
Gruel ghoul, greasy spoon
Used spoon, June bloom

Music seems to help the pain
Seems to motivate the brain
Doctor kindly tell your wife
That I'm alive
Flowers thrive
Realise
Realise
Realise


"
5,The Gnome,"



I want to tell you a story
'Bout a little man, if I can
A gnome named Grimble Grumble
And little gnomes stay in their homes
Eating, sleeping
Drinking their wine

He wore a scarlet tunic
A blue-green hood, it looked quite good
He had a big adventure
Amidst the grass, fresh air at last
Wining, dining
Biding his time

And then one day
Hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Ooh my

Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isn't it good?
Winding, finding places to go

And then one day
Hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Ooh my
Ooh my

6,Chapter 24,"



All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
For seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one

Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset

The time is with the month of winter solstice
When the change is due to come
Thunder in the other course of heaven
Things cannot be destroyed once and for all

Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset, sunrise

All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
The seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one

Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset, sunrise, sunrise, sunrise, sunrise


"
7,The Scarecrow,"



The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere
He didn't care

He stood in a field where barley grows

His head did no thinking
His arms didn't move except when the wind cut up
Rough and mice ran around on the ground

He stood in a field where barley grows

The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
But now he's resigned to his fate
'Cause life's not unkind - he doesn't mind

He stood in a field where barley grows


"
8,Bike,"



I've got a bike, you can ride it if you like
It's got a basket, a bell that rings
And things to make it look good
I'd give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things

I've got a cloak, it's a bit of a joke
There's a tear up the front
It's red and black, I've had it for months
If you think it could look good then I guess it should

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things

I know a mouse, and he hasn't got a house
I don't know why I call him Gerald
He's getting rather old, but he's a good mouse

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things

I've got a clan of gingerbread men
Here's a man, there's a man, lots of gingerbread men
Take a couple if you wish, they're on the dish

You're the kind of girl that fits in with my world
I'll give you anything, everything if you want things

I know a room of musical tunes
Some rhyme, some ching, most of them are clockwork
Let's go into the other room and make them work
