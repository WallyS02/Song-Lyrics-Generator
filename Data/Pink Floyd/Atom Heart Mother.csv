0,If,"



If I were a swan, I'd be gone
If I were a train, I'd be late
And if I were a good man
I'd talk with you more often than I do

If I were asleep, I could dream
If I were afraid, I could hide
If I go insane
Please don't put your wires in my brain

If I were the moon, I'd be cool
If I were a rule, I would bend
If I were a good man
I'd understand the spaces between friends

If I were alone, I would cry
And if I were with you, I'd be home and dry
And if I go insane
Will you still let me join in with the game?

If I were a swan, I'd be gone
If I were a train, I'd be late again
If I were a good man
I'd talk with you more often than I do

1,Summer '68,"



Do, do-do
Do, do-do
Do, do-do-do
Do-do-do-do

Would you like to say something before you leave?
Perhaps you'd care to state exactly how you feel
We say goodbye before we've said hello
I hardly even like you, I shouldn't care at all
We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud
From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year

And I would like to know

How do you feel?
(How do you feel?)
How do you feel?
(How do you feel?)

Not a single word was said, the night still hid our fears
Occasionally you showed a smile, but what was the need
I felt the cold far too soon in a room of 95
My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there
Tomorrow brings another town, another girl like you
Have you time before you leave to greet another man?

Just you let me know

How do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel?

Goodbye to you, Charlotte Pringle's due
I've had enough for one day

2,Fat Old Sun,"



When that fat old sun in the sky is falling,
Summer evening birds are calling.
Summer Sunday and a year,
The sound of music in my ears.

Distant bells,
New-mown grass smells so sweet.
By the river holding hands,
Roll me up and lay me down.

And if you see,
Don't make a sound.
Pick your feet up off the ground.
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a tongue so strange,
Sing to me, sing to me.

When that fat old sun in the sky is falling,
Summer evening birds are calling.
Children's laughter in my ears,
The last sunlight disappears.

And if you see,
Don't make a sound.
Pick your feet up off the ground.
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a tongue so strange,
Sing to me, sing to me.

When that fat old sun in the sky is falling,
Summer evening birds are calling.
Children's laughter in my ears,
The last sunlight disappears.

3,Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast,"



Oh, uh, me flakes, then uh, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, tomatoes... toast, coffee... marmalade, I like marmalade. Yes, porridge is nice. Any cereal, I like all cereals... oh God. Kickoff is 10 a.m.

[Part 1. Rise And Shine]

Breakfast in Los Angeles, macrobiotic stuff...

[Part 2. Sunny Side Up]

I don't mind a barrow, I like barrowing the stuff in
I've got a terrible back. When I work, it hurts me
D'you know what I mean, John?
Well, he's sort of, err... when driving on the road he has a sleep, gets ready for the gig
I don't know
He does all the electrical stuff. I can't be bothered with that, it's so fiddly...

[Part 3. Morning Glory]

All my head's a blank
