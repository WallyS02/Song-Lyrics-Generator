Lime and limpid green
A second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down
The sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground

Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan
Stars can frighten

Lime and limpid green
A second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down
The sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground

Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan
Stars can frighten

Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam. Pow, pow
Stairway scare
Dan Dare
Who's there?

Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds the icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds the icy waters underground

2,Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun (Live),"



Little by little the night turns around
Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning
Under the eaves the swallow is resting

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

Over the mountain watching the watcher
Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine
When one inch of love is one inch of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun...

Witness the man who raves at the wall
Making the shape of his question to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun...

3,Grantchester Meadows,"



Icy wind of night, be gone
This is not your domain
In the sky a bird was heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied a deathly silence that lay all around

Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea

In the lazy water meadow
I lay me down
All around me
Golden sun flakes settle on the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room

Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea

In the lazy water meadow
I lay me down
All around me
Golden sun flakes covering the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into my city room

Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea

Aye an' a bit o' mackerel, fiddler, rack and fear
And I rutted down by the hade and the furrow
Well, I slapped me in a flop and hit down and I shied
And I cried, cried, cried
The fear of fallin' down aft' taken, never back to rise
And then cried 'Mary!' and I tucked up
Wi' a Claymore out and about
And I run down, down the mechyn sty
And beckoned the fiery whore
That was fallin' around the feet
""Never"", I cried. ""Never shall ye get me alive
Ya rotten hound of the Burnie Brae""
Well, I snapped for a blade and a Claymore cut and thrust
And I fell down before him 'round his feet

Aye, a roar he cried! Frae the bottom of his heart
That I would nay fall but dead, dead as a can by a feat deah
And the wind cried back

5,The Narrow Way (Parts 1-3),"



[Part 1]

[Instrumental]

[Part 2]

[Instrumental]

[Part 3]

Following the path as it leads towards
The darkness in the North
Weary strangers' faces show their sympathy
They've seen that hope before

But if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your aching eyes, be on your way

Mist is swirling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar get louder in your ears
You know, the folly was your own
But the force behind can't conquer all your fears

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your aching eyes, be on your way

Throw your thoughts back many years
To the time when there was life in every morning
Perhaps a day will come
When the lights will be as clear as on that morning

And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you, the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't catch the words they say
Close your aching eyes, be on your way
