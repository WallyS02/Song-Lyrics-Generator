0,Cirrus Minor,"



In a churchyard by a river
Lazing in the haze of midday
Laughing in the grasses
And the graves

Yellow bird, you are not lone
In singing and in flying on
In laughing and in leaving

Willow weeping in the water
Waving to the river daughters
Swaying in the ripples and the reeds

On a trip to Cirrus Minor
Saw a crater in the Sun
A thousand miles of moonlight later


"
1,The Nile Song,"



I was standing by the Nile
When I saw the lady smile
I would take her out for a while
For a while

Like tears wept like a child
How her golden hair was blowing wild
Then she spread her wings to fly
For to fly

Soaring high above the breezes
Going always where she pleases
She will make it to the islands
In the sun

I will follow in her shadow
As I watch her from my window
One day I will catch her eye

She is calling from the deep
Summoning my soul to endless sleep
She is bound to drag me down
Drag me down


"
2,Crying Song,"



We smile and smile
We smile and smile
Laughter echoes in your eyes
We climb and climb
We climb and climb
Foot falls softly in the pines
We cry and cry
We cry and cry
Sadness passes in a while
We roll and roll
We roll and roll
Help me roll away the stone


"
3,Green Is The Colour,"



Heavy hung the canopy of blue
Shade my eyes and I can see you
White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore

She lay in the shadow of the wave
Hazy were the visions of her playing
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her blind every time

Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned


"
4,Cymbaline,"



The path you tread is narrow, and the drop is sheer and very high
The ravens all are watching from a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping like a tube-train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end? Will the final couplet rhyme?

And it's high time, Cymbaline
It's high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

A butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in, there's nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agent are both busy on the phone
Selling coloured photographs to magazines back home

And it's high time, Cymbaline
It's high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
And suddenly it strikes you that they're moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing size

And it's high time! (High time), Cymbaline
It's high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

Doh, do-do-ro-ro
Bah bah, ba-ba-ba-ba
Do-do-ro-ro-woah-woah
Bah bah, doo-doo-do-do-ro-ro
Bah bah, ba-ra-ba-ba-ra-ra, bah

And it's high time, Cymbaline
It's high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me


"
5,Ibiza Bar,"



I'm so afraid
Of mistakes that I've made
Shaking every time that I awake
I feel like a cardboard cut-out man
So build me a time
When the characters rhyme
And the story line is kind

I've aged and aged since the first page
I've lived every line that you wrote
Take me down, take me down
From the shelf above your head
And build me a time 
When the characters rhyme
And the story line is kind

I live where I'm left
On the shelf like the rest
And the epilogue reads like a sad song
Please pick up your camera
And use me again
And build me a time 
When the characters rhyme
And the storyline is kind
Yea


"
6,A Spanish Piece,"



Pass the tequila, Manuel

Listen, gringo, laugh at my lisp and I kill you
I think
This Spanish music
It sets my soul on fire
Lovely seÃ±orita
Your eyes are like stars
Your teeth are like pearls
Your ruby lips
