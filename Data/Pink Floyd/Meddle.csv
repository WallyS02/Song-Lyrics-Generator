0,One Of These Days,"



One of these days 
I'm going to cut you into little pieces


"
1,A Pillow Of Winds,"



A cloud of eiderdown
Draws around me softening the sound
Sleepy time when I lie
With my love by my side
And she's breathing low
And the candle dies

When night comes down you lock the door
The boot falls to the floor
As darkness falls the waves roll by
The seasons change
The wind is warm

Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan
Behold a dream, the dream is gone
Green fields
A cold rain is falling
In a golden dawn

And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds and I go down
Sleeping time when I lie
With my love by my side
And she's breathing low
And I rise like a bird
In the haze and the first rays touch the sky
And the night winds die


"
2,Fearless,"



You say the hill's too steep to climb
Chiding
You say you'd like to see me try
Climbing

You pick the place and I'll choose the time

And I will climb that hill in my own way
Just wait a while for the right day
And as I rise above the tree line and the clouds
I look down, hearing the sound of the things you've said today

Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd
Smiling
Merciless the magistrate turns 'round
Frowning

And who's the fool who wears the crown?

And go down in your own way
And every day is the right day
And as you rise above the fear-lines in his brow
You look down, hearing the sound of the faces in the crowd

Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
Liverpool! Liverpool!


"
3,San Tropez,"



As I reach for a peach
Slide a line down behind
A sofa in San Tropez
Breaking a stick with a brick on the sand
Riding a wave in the wake of an old Sedan
Sleeping alone in the drone of the darkness
Scratched by the sand that fell from my love
Deep in my dreams and I still hear her calling
If you're alone, I'll come home

Backward and home-bound
The pigeon the dove
Gone with the wind and the rain on an airplane
Born in a home with no silver spoon
I'm drinking champagne like a good tycoon
Sooner than wait for a break in the weather
I'll gather my far-flung thoughts together
Speeding away on a wind to a new day
If you're alone, I'll come home

And I pause for a while
By a country stile
And listen to things they say

Digging for gold in a hole in my hand
Open the book, take a look at the way things stand
And you're leading me down to the place by the sea
I hear your soft voice calling to me
Making a date for later by phone
And if you're alone I'll come home


"
4,Seamus,"



I was in the kitchen
Seamus, that's the dog, was outside
Well, I was in the kitchen
Seamus, my old hound was outside
Well, you know the sun was sinking slowly
But my old hound-dog sat right down and cried


"
5,Echoes,"



Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky
