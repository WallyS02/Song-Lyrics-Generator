0,Adams apple ,"Back when Cain was able
Way before the stable
Lightning shot right out from the sky
A mothership with fate said
Let's give it a try

Conscience was related
Man, he was created
Lady luck took him by surprise
Her sweet and bitter fruit
It surely opened his eyes

Well, she ate it
Lordy, it was love at first bite
Well, she ate it
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right, right

Even Eve in eden
Voices tried deceivin'
With lies to show the lady the way
At first she stopped and turned
And tried to walk away

Man, he was believer
Lady was deceiver
So the story goes, but you see
The snake was he and she just climbed right up his tree

So, she ate it
Lordy, it was love at first bite
She ate it
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right

Science was related
Man, he was created
When lady luck took him by surprise
Her sweet and bitter fruits
Surely opened his eyes

Evil came like rain
And who knows who's to blame
And something tried to lay her to waste
And all she want to need was just a little taste

So, she ate it
Lordy, it was love at first bite
Yeah, she ate it
Never knowin' wrong for right, right, right, right
Well, she ate it
Lordy, it was love at first bite
Yeah, she ate it
Never knowing wrong from right, right,
Well that's right"
1,Ain't enough ,"Riding a hurricane, tied to a ball and chain
Too much of a good good thing, it kind of stops you in your tracks
How did you ever get this far, now honey don't look back
And you best beleiving that all that's good is inside of you
Heh, inside of you, yeah

Ride on a carpet ride, high on the tears you cried
One's just too many but a thousands not enough
And you can't make up your mind playing blind mans bluff
And you best beleiving that all that's good is inside of you
Yeah, inside of you

It ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough
Ain't enough, I got to have it now ain't it tough
It ain't enough, you got no misery 'cause it ain't enough
ain't enough, you got to have it cause it ain't enough
Oh sheeeit

You know another touch is easy, try and reach the sky
And though you can't get much more higher than you ever tried
When you die you're not forsaken
Best be taking tries of all the things that you're not taking

Ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough
I got to have it ain't it tough
I got to have it

Ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough
I got to have it

Ain't enough, you got no misery 'cause it ain't enough
Ain't enough, you got to have it cause it ain't enough
I got to have it

Ain't enough, I really got to have it
Ain't enough, I really got to have it
Ain't enough, I really got to have it


Ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough 
I got to have it ain't it tough 
I got to have it 

Ain't enough, I take it all but still it ain't enough 
I got to have it 

Ain't enough, you got no misery 'cause it ain't enough 
Ain't enough, you got to have it cause it ain't enough 
I got to have it 

Ain't enough, I really got to have it 
Ain't enough, I really got to have it 
Ain't enough, I really got to have it"
2,Ain't that a bitch ,"Up in smoke you've lost another love
As you take a hit off your last cigarette
Strung out, burnt out
Yeah you're down on your luck
And you don't give a...
'Til the best part of you starts to twitch
Ain't that a bitch

Freak out! I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losin' my mind
'Cause love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find
You think you're high and fine as wine
Then you wind up like a dog in a ditch
'Cause love is like a wrong turn
On a cold night...yeah
Ain't that a bitch, Ain't that a bitch

In a daze
In the throes of emotion
You see God in the Devil's eyes
Then you fall so far from grace
You wouldn't know a kiss
If it was on your face
You can tell it to the jury
But you ain't got no case

Freak out! I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losin' my mind
'Cause love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find
The gal was fine as calamine but not
Enough to scratch a seven year itch
'Cause love is like the last licks
Outta Hendrix... yeah
Ain't that a bitch, Ain?t that a bitch

Then you feel so out of place
Lickin' up the arsenic
From the same old lace
You know the stuff is poison
But you gotta have a taste

You gotta
Freak out! I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losin' my mind
'Cause love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're gonna find
You think you're high and fine as wine
Then you wind up with your face in the ditch
'Cause love is like a warm gun
On a cold night... yeah
Ain't that a bitch, Ain't that a bitch"

4,Amazing ,"I kept the right ones out 
And let the wrong ones in 
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins 
There were times in my life 
When I was goin' insane 
Tryin' to walk through 
The pain 
When I lost my grip 
And I hit the floor 
Yeah,I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door 
I was so sick and tired 
Of livin' a lie 
I was wishin that I would die 

[Chorus:]
It's Amazing 
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light 
It's Amazing 
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright 
It's Amazing 
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight 

That one last shot's a Permanent Vacation 
And how high can you fly with broken wings? 
Life's a journey not a destination 
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings 

You have to learn to crawl 
Before you learn to walk 
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah 
I was out on the street, 
Just tryin' to survive 
Scratchin' to stay alive 

[Chorus]
It's Amazing 
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light 
It's Amazing 
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright 
It's Amazing 
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight 

Desperate hearts, desperate hearts"
5,Angel ,"I'm alone
Yeah I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears
And the cryin' that I do is for you

I want your love
Let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough
I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough
I've suffered and I've seen the light

Ba-yay-by

You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it alright

Don't know what I'm gonna do
About this feeling inside
Yes, it's true
Loneliness took me for a ride

Without your love
I'm nothing but a beggar
Without your love
I'm a dog without a bone
What can I do
I'm sleepin' in this bed alone

Ba-yay-by

You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it alright
Come and save me tonight

You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give
When I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why

Baby, baby, ba-yay-by

You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it alright
You're my angel
Come and save it tonight
You're my angel
Come and take me alright
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight"
6,Angel's Eye ,"What ya gonna do when the angels come 
Get movin', yeah movin' 
I'm gonna get your kicks from the 911 
It's groovin'... so soothing 

Your passions deplete, it's just looking to feed 
Your own fantasy 
The blind side of you is a bad dream come true 
That you can't see 

Chorus: 
From an angel's eye 
Kiss your life goodbye 
From an angel's eye 
Ain't no place to hide 

Tell me what you see through an angel's eye 
The halo... on fire 
You never really know till it's do or die 
Your devil's desire 

Your running in place like a rat in a race 
Going no where 
The evil you speaks from the tongue of the freaks 
So don't go there 

Chorus 

What ya gonna do when the angel's come 
What ya gonna do when you come undone 
I'm gonna get your kicks from the 911 
Ya so bad... can't hold them 

From an angel's eye 
Kiss your life goodbye 
From an angel angel angel's eye 
Ain't no place to hide 

Fallen angel 
Fallen angel 
Fallen angel"
7,Animal Crackers ,"Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Know what I was thinkin'
(What?)
I, I really don't think that the animal cracker
Qualifies as a cracker
(Why?)

Well, 'cause it's sweet which is an in suggest cookie
And when you put a cheese on something
It's sorta the finer characteristic
Of what makes a cracker

Why I thought of that, I just
(Baby, you have such sweet fill-up talk)
Ya got like a little animal cracker, Discovery channel thing
Watch the gazelle as he grazes through the open plains

Now look, as the cheetah approaches
Watch as he stalks his prey
Now the gazelle is a little spooked
He could head north to the manless peaks above or south

The gazelle now faces mans most parlous question
North or south way down tune in next week
(Baby, do you think it's possible)
That anyone else in this world
Is doing this very same thing at this very same moment?

I hope so
Otherwise what the hell are we trying to say?

Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing"
8,Another Last Goodbye ,"Hey, give my heart a break
You say it's you that loves me more
And then you kick and slam your door
Hey, while you' re on your way
I wanna thank you for the ride
And pull the thorn out of my side
And Call me your baby
I kissed away the tears you cry
And then you go and leave me
Pissed off and alone
It's all about your sweet thing
Or maybe it's the devil in your eyes
Yeah what it takes to make this love survive?
Another last goodbye
Another last goodbye
You crash and burn, with the pages turned
In your black book full of names
And then you throw your frozen heart
Out in somebody else's flames
And it's a low down dirty, dirty shame
Don't let this love slip through the cracks
I'll miss your claw marks on my back
And Call me your baby
I kissed away the tears you cry
And then you go and leave me
Pissed off and alone
Yeah It's all about your sweet thing
Or maybe it's the devil in your eyes
Yeah what it takes to make this love survive?
Another last goodbye
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

I believe I'd always be in love with you
Though we got caught up in the sway
Never knowing where we left
Been off the hook and out of hand
Sometimes I feel that love's a crime
'Cuz I remember yeah the very first time
You call me your baby
I kissed away the tears you cried
But then you go and leave me
Pissed off and alone
It's all about your sweet thing
Or maybe it's the devil in your eyes
Yeah what it takes to make this love survive?

Another last goodbye (x8)"
9,Attitude Adjustment ,"This girl that I knew 
She loved me and blew me away 
We made love no doubt 
But she never went out of her way 

I keep wonderin', I keep wonderin' why 
Do the wings of your butterfly 
Lightenin' thunder 
I keep wonderin' why 

Hey I think you need an attitude adjustment 
Knock-down drag out 
I got to make myself a latitude adjustment 
With or without 

I was rather naive 
So I didn't believe when you said 
Our love is in jail 
Honey you hit the nail on the head 

Well I keep wonderin', I keep wonderin' why 
Do the wings of your butterfly 
Lightenin' thunder 
Ainšt no wonderin' why 

Hey I think you need an attitude adjustment 
Knock-down drag out 
Donšt you ever baby, wonder where the lust went 
With or without

Cause I know what you are 
No more cryin' eyes my friend 
Excusem fuckin' moi

Hey I think you need an attitude adjustment 
Knock-down drag out 
I gots to make myself a latitude adjustment 
I'm headin' south 

Yeah I think you need an attitude adjustment 
From inside out"
10,Avant Garden ,"I had a friend 
Who spoke of fate 
And he knew of another place 
In space and time 
He told of how me and my lady 
Could look 
But we could never find 

Said if u please 
I beg your pardon 
Sometimes the things u c 
They just ain't so 
Your life can be 
An avant garden 
Cause love's what makes 
Your garden grow 

The sun leads the way 
The moon lights the sky 
I c u and I 
Lying in my avant garden 
I dream of the day 
When our worlds collide 
We won't be denied 
Here inside r avant garden 

Sometimes my life 
Ain't what it seemin' 
Right from the start it's what your heart's believin' 
Could all this just be 
Lucid dreamin' 
But dreams just ain't 
Enough for me 

The sun leads the way 
The moon lights the sky 
I c u and I 
Lying in my avant garden 
I dream of the day 
When our worlds collide 
We won't be denied 
Here inside r avant garden 

You know it just ain't right 
To deal with other's shite 
No one should ever b 
So broken hearted 
Don't ever b afraid 
Cause when u got it made 
Yeah, u don't even have to try... 

So I'll be waiting in your garden 
Watching all your flowers grow 

The sun leads the way 
The moon lights the sky 
I c u and I 
Lying in my avant garden 
I dream of the day 
When our worlds collide 
You'll know we've arrived 
Here inside r avant garden 

The sun brings the rain 
The moon needs the sky 
I c u and I 
Lying in my avant garden 
Beware of the lies 
A word to the wise 
There's sweet cherry pies 
And truth inside r avant garden"

15,Battlefield ,"It cannot be seen
But there`s blood on the green
Only god knows I`m innocent
Take me, take me home
A dark seed reigns in me
Like the storm rules over the sea
I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone

Don`t dare me now
The threatening shadows will pass by
There`re getting closer now
Open your eyes
Wake up my dear young friend
And hate shall fade away

I will not move, yet
I`ll stand still, instead

There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he`s lost
And on the battlefield it ends

War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you`re driven insane
I`m lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won`t wane `til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It`s gone forevermore

The field`s been left in sorrow
The father and the son
They`re gone

The sun shines bright
And anger rises
Lorn and lonely
Torn apart
Don`t you think
It`s time to stop now
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent`s kiss

Let`s pray
That heaven is on our side
Through violence and horror
Shall honour arise

So let`s pray
And blessed shall be our leader
We follow the noble and bright

Don`t you hear me crying
Crying
Come take me away
I hallow thy name

There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he`s lost
And on the battlefield it ends

War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you`re driven insane
I`m lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won`t wane `til you die
A shattered body deeply"

My best shot for a C note baby she said, 
ÒThat's why this Janie's got a gun 
Because there's nothin like a good time girl 
To take you twice around the world 
I'm so in lust I think I'm trippin' 
So in love I think I'm slippin' 

Down to the river, down to the river of love 
Where the love runs deep it's so sad it's a love you can't keep 

Down to the river, down to the river 
Above 42nd Street it's so sad 
That the bad don't come cheap 

Because there's nothin like a good time girl 
To take you twice around the world 
Right to the land of milk and honey 
Leave your troubles - bring your money

21,Blind Man ,"I took a course in Hallelujah 
I went to night school for de blues 
I took some stuff they said would cool ya...hea ha 
But nothing seemed to light my fuse 

But that's all in the past 
Like a check that's in the mail 
She was a tall whiskey glass 
I was an old hound dog 
That just loved to chase his tail 

Until I met a Blind Man 
Who taught me how to see...yeah 
A Blind Man 
Who could change night into day 
And if a I can 
I'm gonna make you come with me...yeah 
Because a here come the sun 
And we'll be chasing all the clouds away...yeah yeah... 

I've had some lovers like a joyride 
Some things are never what they seem 
My heaven's turned into a landslide 
Thank God I woke up from that dream 

I met a Blind Man 
Who taught me how to see...yeah

Who could change night into day 
And if a I can 
I'm gonna make you come with me...yeah 
Beacuse a here comes the sun 
And we'll be chasing all the clouds the way 
The bee's chase honey 
And drink all the flowers dry 
We'll be saving us a little money 
And if that doesn't do it, yeah 
I know the reason why 

Don't make no sense lightin' candles 
There's too much moonlight in my eyes 

I met a Blind Man

You gotta dance to the tune of Bolivian Ragamuffin 
I'll take short breaks, love her to the outbreaks 

Standing on the seashore, lookin' at the city 
See the street light, dog bite, go lady on the TD8 
The wax museum and nobody gets to see themselves 
There's others care to see what nobody wants to be a baby 

Can't break, cabbage head 
Try and get a salad made 
Hold my pickle, hold the lettuce 
Session waters don't upset us 

Kick, stand, face look so evil, like Knievel 
Never make third base like a toilet bowl cleaner 
Like a squawk eight fool in I don't know orogotus 
If I have to do rock a roller up a jello 

Facial, connish lie 
Smoke a bowl of feeling fine 
Burn and people, try to let us 
Session waters won't upset us 

Hee lee cans (Kick in the pants) 
Water fall (Got on a dance) 
Blame it all (Say gotta eve us a trance) 
Ain't gonna do it 
Ain't gonna do it 
Ain't gonna do it

Been there and back again 

Sixteen years with his boardwalk queen 
And at steeplechase, she used to wet his dreams 
She combs her hair, that flamin' jewel 
Streaked with Clorox bleach

Snortin' up the beach

As it is I'm feelin' like my chips are cashed
All of my clothes strewn all over the room
The crisis at hand is I'm all out of zoom

I got the sunlight blues
I can't find my shoes
The only thing on TV

The tricks of the night keepin' me in a daze
We'll open a bottle and I'll pull down the shades
Glance in the mirror back into bed
We'll get up the same time to party again

It's a shaky situation 
And I'm hangin' on my will

From a hundred dollar bill

 Got me a good old time and cowboy

Trying to look so hard 
All decked out in your antique dress 
While the boys all promenade

If hammer I must

Gonna chip that stone away 
Chip it, I'm gonna nip it

30,Closer ,"How many times can you turn away 
You fall in love and then love falls away 
You turn out the love when you turn out the lights 
You hit the heavens when you hit the heights 

How can I turn up the flame 
You know how it kills me 

Every time you say 
Love is gone away 
I get closer 

It’s a give and take 
Every time we break 
I get closer 

You get closer too, yeah 

I love you baby ‘til death do us part 
If love’s on the mend why not unbreak my heart 
You start so many things so why not let’s dance 
Two times the love for a one time romance 

How can I turn up the flame 
You know how it kills me 

Every time you say 
Love is gone away 
I get closer 

It’s a give and take 
Every time we break 
I get closer 

You get closer too, yeah 

I don’t know why we fight 
What’s wrong with always being right 
It’s always those damnedest things 
Can angels fly on broken wings 

Every night when I’m alone in bed I still smell your perfume 

Then I wake up in a sweat 
I swear I still remember 

Every time you say 
I get closer 

Every time you say 
Love is gone away 
I get closer"
31,Combination ,"The street is cold, the dawn is gray
My heart says no but my head says stay
My work is finished, or so I've been told
You can't part the three of us, once we got a hold

I forgot my name
I took a shot on the chin
I'm rearranging my game
Tell by the shape I'm in

In the line of fire, you know what to say
They gave us no choices, just one shade of gray
My legs keep moving, don't seem to stray
But I know each step we take, they're one step away

I found the secret, the key to the vault
We walked in darkness, kept hittin' the walls
I took the time, to feel for the door
I found the secret, the key to it all

I got the Nouveauree
And dragged it home to bed
I traded you for me
I took it all and said

I find my own fun, sometimes for free
I got to pay it to come looking for me
Walking on Gucci, wearin' Yves Saint Laurent
Barely stay on, 'cause I'm so God damn gaunt

I found the secret, the key to the vault
We walked in darkness, kept hittin' the walls
I took the time, to feel for the door
I found the secret, the key to it all"

The leader, she's small, pinned my ass to the wall
For my seeds or she'd be losin' her past
Time after time, she'd be readin' my mind
But she never got the feelin' to last

Celebrate, celebrate, celebraid it
This is the critical mass

So far so good, I heard the other say
So good so far, they're takin' me away
I drink to you, your mind, her ass
We'll take a drink and break the glass

Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it
This is the critical mass

Now the tallest of two, with a brush full of blue
Paints surrealist scenes on the wall
So I tell her for fun, that it's really well done
But she just ain't listenin' at all

She points to my heart, tellin' me if I'm smart
I'll practice and phase
Out and admit, when the shoe doesn't fit
And I went screaming out down the hall

Really need it
Really need your love
Really need your love
Need your love need your love love love love love love love love love love

Just then I heard a poundin' on the door
We're all here, sang the voice of twenty more
I drink to you alas
We'll take a drink and break the glass

Celebrate, celebrate, celebreak it
We are the critical mass

Time in space, is takin' me away
Time erase, don't know the time of day
Time in space, is takin' me away
Time erase, don't know the time of day

But I'm judge and jury so uh... objection overuled
She did her best just to put on the charm
She said ""i dare you"", I said ""twist my arm""
Donnez-moi un break honey then I paid the cheque
To some psycho chick who's talkin' out the side of her neck
I...i...i tipped my hat, she winked her scandle eyes
And cracked a smile - I was mofo suprised

She's a dime store lover
A dime store lover
Yea a back seat shover
Just a dime store lover....

We was rollin round and round and round
Chantilly took my breath away
Yeah when push came to shove

That she was savin' for a rainy day
We was rollin round and round and round
Chantilly was my cream brule'
I was ooh and ahh, she was ooh la` la`
Un do me baby....

Can't help it yeah I just got to have it

You're a dime store lover
A dime store lover
Just a back page cover
Yeah a dime store lover...."
42,"Don't Get Mad, Get Even ","I'll tell you little secret make you want to jump and shout
When you talk to me in circles take your foot out of your mouth
It's hard enough to make it when you're livin' on the street
And you want to tell somebody but you got to be discreet
Then you catch your girlfriend with her skirt hiked up to here
Honey, don't get mad, get even

Don't get mad, get even [3x]

Say the times they be a-changin' though the blind lead the blind
You know your head is empty though there's somethin' on your mind
Been shackin' up with Lucy, then when the morning comes
You're with Sally in the alley and the junkies and the bums
You wonder why your girlfriend has her skirt hiked up to here
Honey, don't get mad, get even

Don't get mad, get even [3x]

(...'til I can see the white o' your eyes, baby...)
(...I'm gonna kick ass...)
(...just wait 'til you see what I got in store for you)

Roll the dice get lucky 'cause they roll you for the dime
You got nothin' else to lose if you only lose your mind
When pleasure that is shallow causes trouble to be deep
You've been dusted with the devil while he sweeps you off your feet

I'll tell you little secret make you want to jump and shout
When you talk to me in circles take your foot out of your mouth
It's hard enough to make it when you're livin' on the street
And you hate to be a wiseguy when your feet are in concrete
Oh, sleepin' with the dogs, and you wake up with the fleas
Honey, don't get mad, get even"
43,Don't Stop ,"Remember when somebody tried to tell you how to walk 
And now they got the balls to tell us how we should talk 
Though no glove love ain't cool I must agree 
So get outta my face ya' ain't got nothin' on me 

Some say they do and some say they don't 
I take it in stride 
And I can never get enough if I don't have to 
Swallow my pride 
I heard it all before and then she told me 
'Give me some slack' 
And then she smiled at me and gave me the shirt 
Right off her back 
(That's when I took advantage of the situation) 

Don't stop rockin' your socks off 
Don't stop knockin' their blocks off 
Don't stop gettin' your rocks off 
Don't stop takin' the hit boy 
Don't stop shakin' your fist boy 
Don't stop then give 'em this boy (the finger) 

Ain't got much to lose 
I'm feelin so confused 

There's such a small thin line between 
Pleasure and pain 
When you say don't then it's don't stop 
I got to complain 
Yeah I think I may be gettin' real tired of all the schemes 
Because its hard to get the way you move out of my dreams. 
(You gots to get it while you can) 

Don't stop rockin' your socks off 
Don't stop knockin' their blocks off 
Don't stop gettin' your rocks off 
Don't stop takin' the hit boy 
Don't stop shakin' your fist boy 
Don't stop then give 'em this boy (the finger) 
Whenever you're in doubt 
You gots to whip it out! 

When you keep hearin' no 
And your body says yes 
And you can't hear a word that's been said 
But you gotta confess 
Lookin up her address 
Got you thinkin' with your other head 
(Hah hah hah hah hah) 
Don't stop rockin' your socks off 
Don't stop knockin' their blocks off 
Don't stop gettin' your rocks off 

Don't stop takin' the hit boy 
Don't stop shakin' your fist boy 
Don't stop givin' 'em this boy (the finger) 

Don't stop diggin' the hits boy 
Don't stop its as good as it gets boy 
Don't stop squeezin' the tits boy"

No dice honey, I'm livin' on a astral plane
Feet's on the ground, and your head's goin' down the drain
Oh, heads I win, tails you lose, to the never mind
When to draw the line

A Indian summer, Carrie was all over the floor
She was a wet net winner, and rarely ever left the store
She'd sing and dance all night, and wrong all the right outa me
Oh, pass me the vile and cross your fingers, it don't take time
Nowhere to draw the line

Hi ho silver, we were singin' all your cowboy songs
Oh, you told Carrie, and promised her you wouldn't be long
Heads I win, tails you lose, lord it's such a crime
No dice honey, you the salt, you're the queen of the brine
Checkmate honey, you're the only one who's got ta choose
Where to draw the line

Checkmate, don't be late
Take another pull
That's right impossible
When you got to be yourself
You're the boss of the toss
The dice, the price
Grab yourself a slice
Know where to draw the line"

All these lines on my face getting clearer 
The past is gone 
It went by like dusk to dawn 
Isn't that the way 
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay 

Yeah, I know nobody knows 
Where it comes and where it goes 
I know it's everybody's sin 
You got to lose to know how to win 

Half my life's in books' written pages 
Live and learn from fools and from sages 
You know it's true 
All the things come back to you 

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears 
Sing with me, if it's just for today 
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away  
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears 
Sing with me, if it's just for today 
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Dream on , dream on,  dream on  
And dream until your dream come true 
Dream on , dream on,  dream on

49,Eat The Rich ,"Well I woke up this morning
On the wrong side of the bed
And how I got to thinkin'
About all those things you said
About ordinary people
And how they make you sick
And if callin' names kicks back on you
Then I hope this does the trick

'Cause I'm a sick of your complainin'
About how many bills
And I'm sick of all your bitchin'
Bout your poodles and your pills
And I just can't see no humour
About your way of life
And I think I can do more for you
With this here fork and knife

[Chorus:]
Eat the Rich: there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the Rich: take one bite now - come back for more
Eat the Rich: I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the Rich: take one bite now, spit out the rest

So I called up my head shrinker
And I told him what I'd done
Said you'd best go on a diet
Yeah I hope you have some fun
And a don't go burst a bubble
On the rich folks who get rude
'Cause you won't get in no trouble
When you eats that kinda food
Now their smokin' up the junk bonds
And then they go get stiff
And they're dancin' in the yacht club
With Muff and Uncle Biff
But there's one good thing that happens
When you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes may taste like shit
But go real good with wine
[Chorus]

Wake up kid, it's half past your youth
Ain't nothin' really changes but the date
You a grand slammer, but you no Babe Ruth
You gotta learn how to relate
Or you'll be swingin' from the pearly gate
Now you got all the answers, low and behold
You got the right key baby but the wrong key ho, yo

Believe in all the good things
That money just can't buy
Then you won't get no belly ache
From eatin' humble pie
I believe in rags to riches
Your inheritence won't last
So take your Grey Poupon my friend
And shove it up your ass!
[Chorus]

Eat the Rich: there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the Rich: take one bite now - come back for more
Eat the Rich: don't stop me now I'm goin' crazy
Eat the Rich: that's my idea of a good time baby"

She tied me up with my frustration and snapped my robber band
I remember a sweet patchouli she absolutely adored
Its all about with who your hanging & she gave me too much rope

Shes a queen of my deliusion
Shes my Zen from way back when
And because of my confusion 
Is a face without a name

She lived on lucky charms & coffee
And Cracker Jacks surprise
She had me all reborn 
And then she killed me with her eyes

Shes the queen of my deliusion
Shes my friend from way back when
And because of my confusion 
Is a face without a name

Try and get a little bit 
There's really nothing wrong with it 
If no one see's ya
What you gonna say 
When i dont know anyone 
Blame it on the damn amnesia
Forgotten love dont got away 
Shes still a name without a face

We did a little nip & tuck then 
She whispered to my brain
She said lets fuck then 
I forgot her name

Shes the queen of my deliusion
Shes my Zen from way back when
And because of my confusion 
Yeah i've come to that conclusion
And she comes to me at all
And because of my confusion 
Is a face without a name"

If you suffer for your art

So many rivers run dry

I'm a freedom fighter
And I hear your lies
Ain't no truth in your smile

Now you can't walk the streets cause you'll never survive

Right off the ceiling

What did I tell ya 
She buy and sell ya 
'Cause the girl keeps coming apart 

She's so affected 
I'm so rejected 
And the girl keeps coming apart 
Don't, don't, don't, don't let it get me down 
Don't let it get me down 

She's just a screamer 
A nightmare dreamer 
Yeah the girl keeps coming apart 

She's like a call girl 
Loose ends and all girl 
But the girl keeps coming apart 

White lace and leather 
She's so together 
But the girl keeps coming apart

Boxed up and crated 
'Cause the girl keeps coming apart 
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't

Buns up and kneelin' 
I was wheelin' and a dealin' 
My ace in the hole so to speak"

With a thought like that you can't go wrong 
About the girls of summer

Some girls they love to let it fly 
Some girls can't live without it 
Some girls are born to make you cry

My favorite thing that drives me wild 
Is when a city girl walks a country mile 
For a boy she loves God bless the child 
Inside the girls of summer 

Oh yeah... (Do you know... everybody knows now)

Some girls they love to let it fly 
Some girls can't live without it

They get'choo climbin' the walls 
They get'choo caught in their spell 
They get'choo speakin' in tongues 
Could this be Heaven or Hell 
To fall in love twice a day 
Is such a sweet place to be 

Se - vous - play 

The best things about life are free 
The pussywillow up your tree 
To the one who climbs 
They'll always be the girl... yeah 

Some girls are all about it 
Some girls they love to let it fly 
Some girls no doubt about it 
Some girls are born to make you cry 

Some girls can't live without it 
Some girls got twenty reasons why

You gotta revel in the good and badness

Was she still around still alive 

Head first baby how the good time feelin' lingers 
You can be alright on the wrong side of the street 
I'm so hungry for love I be lickin' off all my fingers 
But first you gotta learn to talk the bitter with the sweet 

It's been years since my gears have been turnin' 
Since I asked her to St. Vitas dance 
Have the flames of my poor heart been burnin' 
If it's hate then this must be romance 

Head first baby how the good time feelin' lingers 
You can be alright on the wrong side of the street 
I'm so hungry for love I be lickin' off all my fingers 
But first you gotta learn to talk the bitter with the sweet 

Yeah I feel just like gettin' in trouble 
By the hair on her chinny chin chin 
And I love to get down on her stubble 
With my teeth in a Cheshire grin

Dragged from the cradle, I was weaned in the wild
Ran with the wolfpack, flesh torn to shreds
In the compensations, I was left there for dead

You know who today don't seem to care
Livin', lovin', gettin' loose
Masturbatin' with a noose
Now someone's kickin' out the chair

Some kind of voodoo
Come across this land
Some kind of voodoo
Voodoo medicine man

Everybody's lookin' at the sky
Don't believe the coverups and lies
They been tellin' us since birth
Pissin' off old Mother Earth
My gones are bygones prophesied

Get ready

Wonder should I go or should I stay

I did my best, God knows I tried
I feel like I been crucified
Why did you take it all away

79,I Love Trash ,"Oh, I love trash! 
Anything dirty or dingy or dusty 
Anything ragged or rotten or rusty 
Yes, I love trash 

I have here a sneaker that's tattered and worn 
It's all full of holes and the laces are torn 
A gift from my mother the day I was born 
I love it because it's trash 

I have here some newspaper thirteen months old 
I've wrapped some fish inside it, it's smelly and cold 
But I wouldn't trade it for a big pot o' gold 
I love it because it's trash 

I've a clock that won't work, and an old telephone 
A broken umbrella, a rusty trombone 
And I am delighted to call them my own 
I love them because they're trash 

Yes, I love, I love, I love trash"

It was hotter than fire 
Then came the light 

Oooh, oooh 
Oooh, ah, now smell the heat 
The dancing pony unwrapped his wings 
To dry off Joanie 
The pony he grew in size 
In thunder and rain

A what he was and what he does 
And what he couldn't say

And left to kiss the cheek of Mother Nature

And took to wing

It was everything 
We flew into burning skies 
The thunder and rain

And what he couldn't say 

Oh, no, no... 
Took off in flight 
Oh, no, no...
Then came the light

No sweat, one time fantasy
Bare boned, and all that is the wind it seems
Hell, who's the chick
That rides into my dreams 

No livery 
No stable lights 
No try to please 
Nobody's eyes 
We'll never see us again 
In time it'll pass 
And where did it all begin
But all in good time
Somebody shot an arrow 

Now tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me never 
Wakin' me 'cause you're cold somtimes

Were ruled by Lords of greed
Maidens fared with gold
They dared to bare their wombs that bleed

Kings and queens and guillotines
Taking lives denied
Starch and parchment laid the laws
When bishops took the ride
Only to deceive

Oh I know I lived this life afore
Somehow know now truths I must be sure
Tossin turnin' nightmares burnin' dreams of swords in hand
Sailin' ships the Viking spits the blood of father's land
Only to deceive

Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death fear only loss of pride

Living other centuries
Deja vu or what you please
Follows true to all who do or die

Screams of no reply they died
Screams of no reply and died
Lordy lordy and then then they died
Lordy no then they died

Live and do or die
Long ago were days I told...Lord they died
Kings and queens and guillotines...
Live and no reply they died
Long ago were days I told...

99,Lick And A Promise ,"Johnny come lately on a Saturday night 
Singin' how de do 
Backstreet a boogie in the house of delight 
Where they steal the show 
The money come sour but the ladies are sweet 
It's a love affair 
Whole place rockin', people stompin' their feet 
A when the gang's all there 

He gets his woman every night for free 
He's out there rockin' like you wouldn't believe 
I sing na, na, na, na, na 
Na, na, na, na, na

Johnny like to gamble with his lady Louise 
She was a black jack deuces are wild 
He got to thinking 'bout his nose in the breeze 
Put it there, Johnny looked and he smiled 
He started thinking 'bout the fortune and fame 
With the young girls down at his knees 
He dug the money but forgot all the names 
So he knew just how to appease 

[Chorus:]
Lick and a promise 
Lick and a promise 
Lick and a promise 
He gave the ladies a 
Lick and a promise

Lick and a promise
He gave the ladies a
Lick and a promise 

Loose change grubber in his early, early years 
Had his poor mama pacin' the floors 
He grabbed a guitar and a couple a beers 
Now the crowd keeps screamin' for more 

He gets his woman every night for free
He's out there rockin' like you wouldn't believe

I sing na, na, na, na, na
Sing na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na"

101,Lightning Strikes ,"The boys and Dukes are ready to rumble 
The word on the street some heads are gonna tumble 
Blades gonna flash when the street gangs clash 
In this avenue tonight 

When the lightning strikes 

Zip gun Johnny's finger is itchin' 
Oh the lid's gonna blow up in hell's kitchen 
It's an eye for an eye 
And a tooth for a tooth 
They're so ruthless when they fight 

When the lightning strikes...Oooooh 

And it's a free for all in the parking lot 
Tell me who will rule the street 
And the night explodes 
When the cops bring down the heat 

And the chains they crash like thunder 
While the weak ones all retreat 
Gotta draw first blood 
Or they'll read your funeral rights 

When the lightning strikes 

Uum...it's dog eat dog when you're meetin' your rival 
In the combat zone it's a means of survival 
Gonna get last licks on a suicide blitz 
On a cloak and dagger night 

When the lightning strikes 

Oooh...it's a free for all in the parking lot 
Over who'll rule the street 
And the night explodes 
When the cops bring down the heat 

And the chains they crash like a thunder 
While the weak ones all retreat 
Gotta draw first blood 
Or they'll read your funeral rights 

Oooh, oooh... 

When the lightning strikes 
When the lightning strikes 
When the lightning strikes 
Can'tcha hear the thunder 
When the Lightning Strikes
Can'tcha hear the thunder
When the lightning strikes
Can'tcha, can'tcha, can'tcha hear the thunder
When the lightning strikes
Can'tcha, can'tcha, can'tcha hear the thunder

By the color of his skin 
Then mister you're a better man than I

You can't help yourself at all 
Livin' on the edge 
You can't stop yourself from fallin'

Tell me what you think about your sit-u-a-tion 
Complication - aggravation 
Is getting to you 

If chicken little tells you that the sky is fallin' 
Even if it wasn't would you still come crawlin' 
Back again 
I bet you would my friend 
Again & again & again & again & again 

Tell me what you think about your sit-u-a-tion 
Complication - aggravation 
Is getting to you 

If chicken little tells you that the sky is fallin' 
Even if it was would you still come crawlin' 
Back again 
I bet you would my friend 
Again & again & again & again 

Something right with the world today 
And everybody knows it's wrong 
But we can tell 'em no or we could let it go 
But I'd would rather be a hanging on

104,Lizard Love ,"I was walkin' down the street 
When someone called my name 
She had spiked heels on her feet 
And she was feelin' no pain 

Ohhh must be Lizard Love 

So I hid behind the newspaper 
Turned to page six 
She was in her birthday suit 
Behind a crucifix 

Ohhh must be Lizard Love 

She was hangin' big booty 
She was puss n' boots way up to here 
She's a little bit of heaven, a 24-7 
A 10 every day of the year 

Now there must be some mistake 
I'm feelin' so high strung 
She said 'I make love like a snake 
I even got a forked tongue' 

At first I thought I was dreamin' 
That I'd wake up and she'd dissappear 
But when I opened up my eyes 
She was laughing and a screamin' swinging from the chandlier 

You know I never seem to give 
Or ever get enough 
And I just can't seem to live without 
That sweet bodacious stuff 

Ohhh must be Lizard Love"
105,Lord Of The Thighs ,"Down to who knows who, just to socialize. 
I'm waiting for my girls, when you call my eyes. 
You got no way to make a man honey, 
You got to understand. 
I'm your man, child. Lord of the Thighs. 

Well, well, Lordie my God, 
What do we got here? 
She's flashin' 'cross the floor, 
Make it perfectly clear. 
You're the bait, and you're the hook, 
Someone 'bound to take a look. 
I'm your man, child. Lord of the Thighs. 

You must of come here to find it, 
You've got the look in your eyes. 
Although you really don't mind it - 
I am the Lord of your Thighs! 

You must of come here to find it baby, 
You've got the look in your eyes. 
Although you really don't mind it - 
I am the Lord of your Thighs!"

I'm gonna have a fantasy
But where am I gonna look?
They tell me that love is blind
I really need a girl like an open book
to read between the lines

Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground

Jacki's in the elevator
Lingerie second floor
She said 'can I see you later
And love you just a little more?'
I kinda hope we get stuck
nobody gets out alive
She said I'll show ya how to fax in the mailroom honey 
and have you home by five

Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down

Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I hit the ground

Gonna be a penthouse pauper
Gonna be a millionaire
I'm gonna be a real fast talker
and have me a love affair
Gotta get my timin' right
It's a test that I gotta pass
I'll chase you all the way to teh stairway honey
Kiss your sassafras

Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up 'til I hit the ground

Do you care? Do you care?
Honey one more time now it ain't fair.

Why don’t you know, don’t you know, don’t you?

Ah there’s a chill in the summer time air
You get a thrill from the smell of her hair
You get a high from the taste of her wits
It’s certified, but but, but you ain’t getting there yet
Still can’t forgive but baby cut me some slack
Still got a feel you ain’t never coming back
You don’t want the karma but you won’t commit
You’ll be sṗanking your monkey when she’s all up in your shit

Is that your girl in a lily white dress
How come she’s so f*ing passive-agress
I hear you say with your adorable tongue
And that you just don’t care how especially yeah
While the night is still young
Still you raise your imagination
Do that ration, generation, single patience
Contamination, suffocation

No thanks I took that ride

Do not attempt to adjust the illusion
We control the harmonics
We control your emotions
We will move you to the left
We will move you to the right
We can reduce the volume to a whisper
Or increase it to a deafening roar
Now is the time to submit quietly
We control all you hear and feel
You are about to enter a great adventure
And experience the odd and mystery
From your ultimate fantasies, to your deepest fears
From which you may never return

Top hat glovers, kissin' lipstick girls
Kissin' high heel lovers with the serious swirls

Love three times a day
Ain't no other way
And then a matinee
It's time that you be takin' a stand

That could love me like a lover yeah but this kinda girl
Had a way that she loved that nobody else could
In a way that she could love that everybody understood
Butta too bad for you when you ain't got no
When you be getting out of jail, we're gonna all have fun
Where's your game face, baby? Don't chaa look so sad!

116,Melt Down ,"The streets were cold and barren 
The nights were dark and dank 
And the sky, hadn't had a rain cloud in it for 25 years.... 
The buildings were dead and the alleys 
Stunk from things that used to live there 
Ahhh that wasn't the city I remembered 

A Child in the street, barefoot pullin' at his 
Mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence 
With not a scrap left on the plate 
And so much like a fable, their lives so unstable 
Cause the only thing left was their faith 
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do 
About it.... 

There's a Meltdown in the sky 
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why 
There's a fear that gets me high 
And the cold night numbs as the Jet Black clouds roll on by.... 

So sad was the scene that my eyes did behold 
Made me wonder just who was the foe 
And was it all to come true what Nostradamus 
Had predicted such a long long time ago? 
You could hear screams and moanin' 
From the people atoning 
For their sins of a guilt ridden life 
And the final door shuts 
From the wind that leaves cuts 
From the edge on the blade of God's knife 
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do about.... 

There's a Melt Down in the Sky 
There's a new day comin and I don't know why 
There's a tear stuck in my eye 
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why 

Battle lines had been drawn 
Mother nature how she cried 
By her side, till the dawn 
Couldn't kill her if they tried 
How they tried, open eyed, genocide 
Then... she died 

Battle lines had been drawn 
Mother nature how she cried

There's a Meltdown in the sky 
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why 
There's a fear that gets me high 
And the cold night numbs as the Jet Black clouds roll on by...."

119,Monkey On My Back ,"(oh it's me and i've been down yeah
Got to get that monkey outa-off my back)

The fortune teller looked into my eyballs
The wrinkles on her face about to crack
She said ' you best believe it,
You ain't goin' nowhere, unless you get that
Monkey off your back'

I made believe the devil made me do it
I was the evil leader of the pack
You best believ i had it all and then i blew it
Feedin' that fuckin' monkey on my back

If you put it a spoon man i would boot it
Some king whose mental house was just a shack
Where do you draw the line when all your friends are dyin'
You got to get that mokey off your back
Uh, uh, uh....

Your crystal ball is where you chase the dragon
She said, 'now' i bring me home his head inside a sack
But now you find your crystal balls are dragin'
Got to get that monkey off your back"

Come on asking you, honey,
Feet, don't fail me now

My girl, she bareback rider
And my girl, she laid in your diamond
And she a full time lover, no moan at me
Sweeter than the honey from a honey bee
And it all rubs off on little old me old my

My girl, she smokes barbed wire
And my girl can't get no higher
I'm livin' with the lady with the one tracked mind
Diamonds in the rough are so hard to find
Day after day it's the same old
Grind and grind and grind and grind and grind and grind and grind

My girl, my girl, my girl, my girl

You're a liar and you're a cheat 
I don't know why I let you do these thing to me 
My friends keep telling me that you ain't no good 
They don't know that I would leave you if I could 
I guess I'm on tight 
And I'm stuck like glue 
Cause I ain't never 
I ain't never 
I ain't never... no... no... 
Loved a girl the way that I 
I love you 

Sometimes I think I know 
You would run out of fools 
But I was so wrong 
You got one that you'll never lose 
The way you treat me is shame 
How could you hurt me so bad 
Baby you know that I'm the best thing that you ever had 
Kiss me once again 
Don't you never never say that we're through 
Cause I ain't never 
Never 
Never no no 
Loved a girl the way that I 
I love you 

I can't sleep at night I can't eat a bite 
I guess I'll never be free 
Since you got your hooks in me 

I ain't never loved a girl 
I ain't never loved a girl 
Ain't never loved a girl that hurt me so bad 
What am I gonna do about it 
I tell you I'm gonna hold on to her 
I'm gonna hold on to her"
125,Nine Lives ,"Well well well 
I feel just like I'm fallin' in love 
There's a new cool 
Some kind of verbooty 
That fits me like a velvet glove 

And it's cool 
Shu bop a doo ba 
She's talkin' to me Juba to Jive 
Yeah, the girl's in love 
No doubt about it 
The moment of truth has arrived 

And in a wink 
The funk was all around me 
And I think 
I'm dead in love again 

Nine Lives - Feelin' lucky 
Nine Lives - Live again 
Nine Lives - It ain't over 
Nine Lives - Live for ten 

I got good luck 
In certain situations 
I'm feelin' like I hung the moon 
And then at times 
I'm so weak from lovin' 
I couldn't even carry a tune 

But now I'm back 
Oh yes I am 
I maybe fall apart at the seams 
I had a nightmare 
Believe me when I tell you 
Nobody ever dies in their dreams 

I think I need a stay of execution 
In a wink, I'm dead in love again 

Nine Lives - Puss & booty 
Nine Lives - Live again 
Nine Lives - It ain't over 
Nine Lives - Live for ten 

Well well well 
Engine room to bombardier 
Is this a dream 
I died and went to Heaven 
She's enough to make you 
Cry in your beer 

How can a good thing 
7 come 11 
Slip into a fare thee well 
And how can one man's 
Little bit o' Heaven 
Turn into another man's Hell 

I think I need a stay of execution 
Yeah I know, I'm dead in love again 

Nine Lives - Hello lucky 
Nine Lives - Live again 
Nine Lives - It ain't over 
Nine Lives - Try for ten 

Nine Lives - Takin' over 
Nine Lives - Live again

126,No More No More ,"Blood stains the ivories
Of my daddy's baby grand
I ain't' seen no daylight
Since we started this band

[Chorus]
No More, No More[x2]

Store bought clothes
Falling appart at the seams
Tea leaf reading gypsies
Fortune telling my dreams

[Chorus]

Holiday Inns, lock the door with a chain
You love it and you hate it
But to me they're all the same

[Chorus]

Baby I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage

Stalemate jailbait
Ladies can't refuse
You love them then you leave them
With your sold out reviews

[Chorus]

Sweet talking barroom, ladies' disease
Slipping with her lips
Sliding down your knees

[Chorus]

Baby I'm a screamer
Bound to a wife in marriage
Baby, I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage
Ladies hold the aces
And their lovers call it passion
The men call it pleasure
But to me it's old fashioned
Times they're a changing
Nothing ever stands still
If I don't stop changing
I'll be writing out my will

It's the same old story
Never get a second chance
For a dance to the top of the hill

Baby I'm a dreamer
Found my horse and carriage"
127,No Surprize ,"1971, we all heard the starters gun 
New York is such a pity 
But at Max's Kansas City we won 

We all shot the shit at the bar 
With Johnny O' Toole and his scar 
And then old Clive Davis said 
He's surely gonna make us a star 
I'm gonna make you a star
Just the way you are 

But with all his style 
I could see in his eyes 
That we is goin' on trial 
And it was no surprize 

The boys kept kickin' ass 
As usual time would tell 
But some bitch in the choir 
Throw water on the fires of hell 
She loved to show and tell 
Lord, she loved to tell 

But with all our style 
You could see in our eyes 
That we is still on trial 
And it was no surprize 
No surprize 
No surprize 
No surprize 

Midnight lady 
Situation fetal 
Vaccinate your ass with your phonograph needle 

I say looky here 
Friend of mine 
You scratch like you need calamine 
Flamingo boots, soles a creakin' 
Still in love and Puerto Rican too 

Ridin' on wheels of hell 
Smokin' our axle grease 
Oh, the backstage is rockin' 
And we're coppin' from the local police 
That's right, the local police 
Or the juctice of peace 

But with all our style 
You could see in our eyes 
That we is still on trial 
Baby, it's no surprize 
No surprize 
No surprize 
No surprize 

Rock n' roll, junkie whore 
Got my foot inside the door 
Knock knock, knock knock, knock 
Nobody's keepin' score 

Bad times go away 
Come again some other day 
Topaz and sazzafraz 
Will keep the blues away 

Candy store, rock n' roll 
Corporation jellyroll 
Play the singles, it ain't me 
It's programmed insanity 

You ASCAP, if BMI 
Could ever make a mountain fly 
If Japanese can boil teas 
Then where the fuck's my royalties...aar
Yak yak yak yak 'oow"
128,Nobody's Fault ,"Lord I must be dreamin' 
What else could this be 
Everybody's screamin' 
Running' for the sea 

Holy lands are sinkin' 
Birds take to the sky 
The prophets are all stinking drunk 
I know the reason why 

Eyes are full of desire 
Mind is so ill at ease 
Everything is on fire 
Shit piled up to the knees 
Out of rhyme or reason 
Everyone's to blame 
Children of the season 
Don't be lame 

Sorry, you're so sorry 
Don't be sorry 
Man has known 
And now he's blown it 
Upside down and hell's the only sound 
We did an awful job 
And now they say it's nobody's fault 

Old St. Andres 
Seven years ago 
Shove it up their richters 
Red lines stop and go 
Noblemen of courage 
Listen with their ears 
Spoke but how discouragin' 
When no one really hears 

One of these day's you'll be sorry 
Too many houses on the stilt 
Three million years or just a story 
Four on the floor up to the hilt 

Out of rhyme or reason
Everyone's to blame
Children of the season
Don't be lame

Sorry, we're so sorry
Don't be sorry
Man has known 
And now he's blown it 
Upside down and hell's the only sound 
We did an awful job 
And now we're just a little too late 

Eyes are full of desire 
Mind is so ill at ease 
Everything is on fire 
Shit piled up in debris 

California showtime 
Five o'clock's the news 
Everybody's concubine 
Was prone to take a snooze 

Sorry, we're so sorry
Don't be sorry
Man has known
And now he's blown it
Upside down and hell's the only sound
We did an aweful job
And now we're just a little too late"

I try to hold on to them with all my might
Precious time spent with you goes by much too fast
Like snow in the sun it just never seems to last

Another empty day
Suddenly last night is just so far away
Too many talking heads
What was it that they said
When we're apart the days are dark
When I'm with you I'm in the light

You're my oasis in the night... yeah
You're my oasis in the night
You're my oasis in the night

Time's too short
The fire's too hot
Don't know what to do
'Cause I know in a flash
It's just a memory too

Another tasteless coffee
Another empty day
Suddenly last night is just so far away
Too many talking heads
What was it that they said
When we're apart my days are dark
When I'm with you I'm in the light

You're my oasis in the night
You're my oasis in the night
You're my oasis in the night

With only myself to blame 
Fate ran its course, I suffered a loss 
I learned a lesson in pain 

Cheated, lied, I took love for granted 
Oh, I paid the price 
I won't last a night 
I won't make the same mistake twice 

Once is enough, it's one time too many 
The changes are rough, ooh, once is enough 

Love went through such sudden change 
Taken a turn for the worst 
The joy turned to fear, the pain got so severe 
Lord, I thought I was cursed 

Get what you give, it comes around full circle 
Ooh, I paid the price 
Love so fast 
I won't make the same mistake twice 

Once is enough, it's one time too many 
Changes are rough, ooh, once is enough 
Changes are rough, ooh, once is enough"

You know your brother Spike
He's on the level
But you always lookin'
Like you're mad at the devil

Don't say I copped a 'tude
It's all forgotten
It's just you're much too rude
Your fruits are rotten

You know I work so hard to keep it alive

Is nothing but jive

Lately it's been so hard
Now to make ends meet

Ya-ya baby till Out Goes the Lights

If you wanna take a lookie cookie tonight might be your lucky nighty night night

How they go déjà-booty
You’re a yaya baby tonight
Way to go thought you knew me

But it’s cool
Too cool for cat
A little bit of this and a little bit of that
Had a red hot maybe on a cold summer night
Ya-ya baby till Out Goes The Lights

If you wanna taste the cookie lookie tonight might be your lucky

The things that we see are so out of sight
We’ll have to see when we turn out the light

Living on coochie and romance
Waiting on Cupid to call
Some people say that’s livin’
Yeah but that ain’t livin’ at all
And it’s cool, that’s how I roll
You get a little lovin’ if you got a lot of soul
And it’s for sure, when love’s just right
Ya-ya baby when Out Goes the Lights

If you want a little nookie cookie tonight might be your lucky

Roses are red, My lips on you
But you couldn’t tell by the things that we do
The things that we see are so out of sight
We’ll have to see when we turn out the light

Ooh-aa-oo Yeah Yeah (repeats till end)"
135,Outta Your Head ,"All the way back in history 
How a girl thinks is a mystery 
We spend our lives 
Cruising the bars 
The Venus girls and 
The men from Mars 

So in all this time did u ever think 
Do the girl see red 
When a man a sees pink 
And if your best lovin's in the past 
Cuz your somewhere slow 
Is nowhere fast 

You're outta your head 
So outta your head 
Stay outta your head 
You better get with it 
Cuz you're so without it 
You're outta your head 
So outta your head 
Stay outta your head

Bricka bracka fiya kraka 
Sis boom-bah! 
Here comes trouble 
In a push up bra 
Your style is sharp as carpet tack 
But you're out of your box and you're way off track 

You can moderate on 
A mental binge 
Your catastrophe's 
On a lunatic fringe 
It's good for the gander 
It's tit for tat 
You say it's all good 
But it's more than that 

You're outta your head 
So outta your head 
Stay outta your head 
Yeah, yeah 
Somewhere, somewhere underneath the rainbow 

So in all this time did you ever think

137,Painted on my heart ,"
I thought you'd be out of my mind
And I'd finally found a way to learn to live without you
I thought it was just a matter of time
Till I had a hundred reasons not to think about you

But it's just not so,
After all this time, I still can't let go

I still got your face
Painted on my heart
Scrawled upon my soul
Etched upon my memory, baby

And I've got your kiss
Still burning on my lips
Your touch in my fingertips
This love so deep inside of me, baby

I've still got your face
Painted on my heart... yea, painted on my,

I've tried everything that I can
To get my heart to forget you
But it just can't seem to

I guess it's just no use
In every part of me
Is a little a part of you

And I've still got your face
Painted on my heart
Scrawled upon my soul
Etched upon my memory, baby

I've got your kiss
Still burning on my lips
Your touch in my fingertips
This love so deep inside of me, baby

I've still got your face,
Painted on my heart,
Painted on my heart,
Painted on my, yea, yea yea... yea...

Something in your eyes keeps haunting me
I'm trying to escape you
And I know there ain't no way to
To chase you from my mind...

I've still got your face
Painted on my heart
Scrawled upon my soul
Etched upon my memory baby

I've got your kiss
Still burning on my lips
Your touch in my fingertips
This love so deep inside of me, baby

I've still got your face
Painted on my heaaaart...

Painted on my heart...
Paiiiinted on my heaaaart...

Painted, pai..., painted on my heart...

138,Pandora's Box ,"When I'm in heat
Someone gets a notion
I jump to my feet
I hoof it to the ocean
We hit a beach
Where no one gives a hoot
Nobody never ever wears a suit
The ladies there
They look so proud
That's 'cause they know
That they've been so well endowed

Now, I ain't much
For Fannie's conversation
Or care to much
About her operation
But every time Pandora comes my way
I get high
Can't explain the sensation
To get it on
I gotta watch what I say
Or I'll catch hell
From the women's liberation

(Chorus)

Sweet Pandora
God-like aura
Smell like a flora
Open up your door-a for me
Sweet Pandora
God-like aura
Smell like a flora
Open up your door-a for me
Sweet Pandora
Mama crack a smile for me
Just for me, just for me
Just for me, just for me
Just for me, just for me
Just for me

Now I ain't what
You'd call a city slicker
Or claim to fame
To be a slitty licker

But every time Pandora comes my way
I get high
Can't explain the sensation
To get it on
I gotta watch what I say
Or I'll catch hell
From the women's liberation

My nose is clean and lordie don't need no sedation 
Yeah, yeah, and that's the reason why 

I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez 
I want a tan where the sun, it never shines 
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez 
You best believe it that I go to get away 

I got a sister man she really got a pinhead 
She think she kinky but she can't get straight 
She say she livin' but I kinda think she brain dead 
Just excess baggage on a late night freight

The girl's be cummin' down in Cayman Brack 
I gotta hand it to a firm situation 
Yeah, yeah, I got to cut me some slack"

Pink it's not even a question, 
Pink on the lips of your lover, 'cause 
Pink is the love you discover 

Pink as the bing on your cherry 
Pink 'cause you are so very 
Pink it's the color of passion 
'Cause today it just goes with the fashion 

Pink it was love at first sight 
Pink when I turn out the light, and 
Pink gets me high as a kite 
And I think everything is going to be all right 
No matter what we do tonight 

You could be my flamingo

Pink like a deco umbrella 
It's kink - but you don't ever tell her

And I think everything is going to be all right 
No matter what we do tonight"
141,Prelude To Joanie ,"At first we three thought 
'Twas the biblical cord of life 
Then noticing 'twas connected 
To his head 
How strange 
Not to be believed 
I reached out to feel 
And the pony's eyes they opened 
The cord got hard 
The head looked around 
And you know who pushed and gushed 
The waters of life 
First two hooved feet 
Then the shine of his fur 
But at first to my eyes only 
Feather - feather - wings 
The butterflies flew up in such colors 
Exploding all around us 
The rest I did not see 
Till there he stood 
All eyes in wonder 
Who me - who you 
Look"

With blonde hair, by crack it

And the toys in the attic

Her candle of youth was burnin' low
But me and the boys
Knew something had to go

And his wife's aggravation
You'll soon end up dead

It's the same old story
Same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story
Same old song and dance, my friend

Gotcha with the cocaine
They found with your gun
No smooth face laywer
Could get ya undone
Say love ain't the same
On the south side of town
You could look
But you ain't gonna find it around

It's the same old story
Same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story
Same old story
Same old song and dance

Fate comes a-knockin'
Doors start lockin'
Your old time connection
Change your direction
You ain't gonna change it
Can't rearrange it
Can't stand the pain
When it's all the same to you, my friend

When you're low down and dirty
From walkin' the street
With your old hurdy gurdy
No one to meet
Said love ain't the same
On the south side of town
You could look
But you ain't gonna find it around

It's the same old story
Same old song and dance, my friend
It's the same old story
Same old story
Same old song and dance"

159,Seasons Of A Wither ,"Blues hearted lady sleepy was she
Love for the devil brought her to me
Sea's of a thousand drawn to her sin
Seasons of wither holdin' me in

Ooh woe is me I feel so badly for you
Ooh woe is me I feel so sadly for you
In time bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sail

Fireflies dance in the heat of
Hound dogs that bay at the moon
My ship leans in the wind I
Can't say I'll be back too soon

They awaken far far away
Heat of my candle show me the way
Sea's of a thousand drawn to her sin
Seasons of wither holdin' me in

Ooh woe is me I feel so badly for you
Ooh woe is me I feel so sadly for you
In time bound to lose your mind
Live on borrowed time
Take the wind right out of your sail"

Cought up in a city way 
A nitty gritty boy 
Stayin' out all night 
And always gettin blown away 

There ain't no breeze to cool the heat of love 

She was a city girl 
With no responsibility 
A pretty little city girl 
All fired up and what's 
That got to do to me 

There ain't no breeze to cool the heat of love 

It's as clear as a 
Sunrise in Sudona 
Just what it is 
That's blowin' in the wind 
It's the fire in her eyes 
It's the tear when she cries 
It's the heat when I fall on my knees 
That I'm thinkin' of 

There ain't no breeze to cool the heat of love 

It's as clear as a 
Sunrise in Sudona

Lady luck and the four leaf clover
Won't be as hurt as I feel all over
My life for one special occasion
'Til you leave in depth the situation

Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

My car got repossessed this morning
Harder times I haven't seen in years
Able to throw me a life preserver
'Cos I'm about to drown in my own tears

Well well well standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

Well well well standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down

Ever since you put me down

Talk is cheap, shut up and dance 
Don't get deep, shut up and dance 

Love has got me down 
The weight is all around 
So you lend a hand to peace on earth 
Here's my piece, now what's it worth 
Yea, but it's all right 

When you can't define the crime 
Then life ain't worth a dime 
When they take away everything you got 
And they rub your nose in the funky spot 
Not without a fight 

When you work your fingers to the bone 
And what does that get you--NOTHING 
If in a crowd of people 
You're still alone 
I hope that tells you something 

The road to heaven is paved in hell 
And it makes you wonder 
Why you're here at all 

Check out the shape of your circumstance 
He wears the dress and she wears the pants 
Here comes Jill and she needs romance 
But you can't do jack so shut up and dance! 

Sex is like a gun 
You aim, you shoot, you run 
When you're splittin hairs with Mr. Clean 
It' like gettin head from a guillotine 
And the night has just begun

Naked foul while under there
Underwear that's pretty gritty

She's a love lust hussy
She left, oh, she rust me
Dear old girl

She was a sight for sore eyes but she was sittin' pretty
Sight for sore eyes she was a nitty gritty
Sight for sore eyes

Peeled back and parted 
Even in the car
It was delight or demise
I'm livin' like a leopard king

Lightnin' years disappearsne
Twenty million years on my brain
Synthesize, overrides
Tryin' to keep from goin' insane

And my soul I can not feel
'Cause they made me so unreal

Spaced enough to know I feel there's nothing out there
Spaced enough to know I feel I really don't care
Spaced enough to feel I'm really losin' my mind

And I'm never ever goin' back
I lost the track
No one even knows I'm alive
Spaced without a trace
Waitin' for the word to arrive
I'm the last man to survive

Without a trace
Waitin' for the word to arrive
I'm the last man to survive"

Lay down your bloody sword

179,Street Jesus ,"Hey have you heard the news?
Somebody stole my shoes
And I can smell the booze
How indiscreet

And though I had a plan
After that thief outran
Into another man
Who had no feet

I swear to god that day
That guy with no feet say
“You got to walk my way”
“That’s how it’s planned”

That’s when I thought, “good grief”
J-Just ain’t my belief
Until I saw the holes
Inside his hand

Street Jesus
Street Jesus

Come on, come on, what you think about life?
Demon in heaven gotta carry a knife
You said to me, “no, that ain’t the plan”
With a smile on his face and the holes in his hand

Wise man tell ya what they’re reading from a scroll
But things kinda change when the story gets told
They tell it like it is to everybody they meet
Just to sing it in the church what they’re preaching in the street

Placate and vacate your mind
Too late to make hate you’ll find

Streeeeeeeet Jeesuuuus
Streeeeeeeet Jeesuuuus

Good God Almighty, s’posed to be about love
You must’ve wished upon me by kissing the glove
I’m a high-stepping lover, sharp as a knife
I’m a pink flamingo on a great long life
A wise man, poor man, beggar man too
You bet your bottom dollar but whatcha gonna do?
I can make up daylight jealous of the night
I try to play the game but I never get it right!

Placate and vacate your mind
Too late to make hate you’ll find

When you wonder what’s up
With your half empty cup
Say tell him “don’t give up,
“Reach for the stars”

You think you’re so street wise
Just pray and close your eyes
Until we colonize
The moon and stars

But wouldn’t it be great
If we could wipe the slate
When we all live in hate
And all this fear

So please don’t call me “sir”
If you’re whole life’s a blur
And Mr. Bartender
Another beer

Sometimes it’s hard trying to keep up the pace
The train kept a rollin’ when you’re trying to win the race
If you don’t believe me, wanna stay in the game
You gotta know who from the heavens came

They tell it like it is to everybody they meet
Cause they’re singing in the church what they’re preaching in the street
If you wanna give ‘em hell then you tell it from the steeple
But I’d rather be a priest so I can scream it to the people

Placate and vacate your mind
Too late to make hate you’ll find
You won’t get too many tries
Love is the love of my life

Street Jesus
Street Jesus

Street Jesus
Street Jesus

Street Jesus

185,Tell Me ,"I think it’s time to realize it’s done 
I guess I have to accept it 
I was never the one 
Yeaaah, it was so good 
I thought I fell into someone else’s dream 
Yeah, but I let it be my, thought to let be yours 
Now nothing’s ever what it seems 
I thought I felt it all around 
But now it’s laying there on the ground 
Why was it there for me, but not for you? 
Tell me, tell me, 
It comes as bliss of love, now I’m sitting here 
And you’re so far gone 

I’m staring down the page in a magazine 
I looked up at the tv, but it’s just an empty screen
When we’re together, I thought it was ecstasy 
Oh I can tell the sun’s still shining 
But shadows are all I can see 
And everywhere I go, I’ll never see your face I know 
What could I say, that could make you come back this way 
Tell me, tell me, 
It comes as bliss of love, now I’m sitting here 
And you’re so far gone 

Now I know I should have known 
And I see I could have seen 
You gotta rest your soul 
I need to know, I want to find out 
If your fields are still green, whoaaa 

[Guitar solo] 

Now I hope that what I have found 
Could somehow be true 
Why is it such a long long way and you 
Tell me, tell me 
It comes as bliss of love, now I’m sitting here 
And you’re so far gone."

194,Theme From Spiderman ,"Spider-man, Spider-man 
Does whatever a spider can 
Spins a web, any size 
Catches thieves, just like flies 
Look out! Here comes the Spider-man! 

Is he strong? Listen, Bud! 
He's got radioactive blood. 
Can he swing from a thread? 
Take a look overhead. 
Hey there, there goes the Spider-man! 

In the chill of night, 
At the scene of the crime 
Like a streak of light 
He arrives just in time 

Spider-man, Spider-man 
Friendly neighborhood Spider-man 
Wealth and fame, he's ignored 
Action is his reward 
To him, life is a great big bang-up 
Wherever there's a hang-up 
You'll find the Spider-man!"
195,Think About It ,"When will the clouds all blow it away
When will the good people have their say
Now I hope you're still around to see the day

Take a while, Think About It
Take a while, Think About It
Take a while, Think About It

Who's gonna tell what is up or down
Who can be the king or be the clown
Then climb your tree, take a look around

Take a while, Think About It
Take a while, Think About It
Take a while, Think About It

Take it nobody out, if it in the tame
That which is now, will be again
Who can decide who is insane

Take a while, Think About It
Take a while, Think About It
Take a while, Think About It"

Take a walk in the warm New England sun 
Ain't no time to look for clues

He used to raise all kinds of hell 
He took a dose of radiation dope 
A back in the barn is where he felt, like hell

That she'd get by and maybe someday she'd see
But soon she found her mother's love for all the others
The pushers and the shovers was the life to lead

And when she cried at night, went insane

Get myself back on the ground

Up on the hill
Lay down by the river
Let the water be still
I'll open my eyes
And see what I see
I got to find out
What is you
And what is me

I used to know how to feel
Somethin' tells me this ain't real
On the phone ain't nothin' said
It's off the hook the line is dead

Things you want the things you need
I ain't got and ain't guaranteed
I'm breakin' loose it's building up
And I can't leave here soon enough

Oh no
Oh no

206,Walk This Way ,"Backstroke lover, always hidin' 'neath the covers
Til I talked to my daddy, he say
He said ""You ain't seen nothin'
Til' you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways.""

I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
Oh, times I could reminisce
Cause the best things of lovin' with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss, a-like this

Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flying up in the air
A-sing ""Hey, Diddle Diddle"" with your kitty in the middle
At the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was foolin'?
Cause she knew what she was doin'
Then I knowed love was here to stay

When she told me to
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
A-just gimme a kiss

A-like this
Ooh
Uh

School girl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss a-like this

Seesaw swing with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' ""Hey, Diddle Diddle"" with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me, she was foolin'
Cause she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way

She told me to
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Just gimme a kiss

Like this"

Silver buttons up and down her back

She broke a needle now she can't sew

Walkin' the dog
I'm just a-walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog

Ask my mama for fifteen cent
To see the elephant jump the fence
It jumped so high, it touched the sky
Didn't come back till the fourth of July

Walkin' the dog
I'm just a-walkin' your dog
Well if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk your dog

Mary Mary, quite contrary
How does your garden grow
Well well, silver bells and little bitty bitty white shells
Pretty maids all in a row

210,We All Fall Down ,"When your heart is breakin'
When your faith has been shaken
When the road you're takin'
Takes you nowhere at all

When it all, seems to all go wrong
Remember, nobody, can always be strong.

We all fall down...

I will catch you, never let you go
I won't let you, go through it alone
So don't feel left out, we all fall down
We all fall down

When your dreams are shattered
When you feel broken and battered
When every step on the ladder
Takes you nowhere but down

And you lose ground, like you can't hold on

Remember, nobody, can always be strong.

We all fall down...

I will catch you, never let you go
I won't let you, go though it alone
So don't feel left out, we all fall.
I will lift you, high above the rain
I'll be with you, we all feel the pain
So don't feel left out, we all fall down
We all fall down

Everyone breaks
You'll get hurt sometimes, in this life
You fly so high, you crash and burn sometimes
And I want you to know, you are not alone

We all fall down (we all fall down)

I will catch you, never let you go
I won't let you, go through it alone
So don't feel left out, we all fall.
I will lift you, high above the rain
I'll be with you, we all feel the pain
So don't feel left out, we all fall down
We all fall.

I will catch you.
I wont' let you.
So don't feel left out, we all fall down
We all fall down"
211,Wham bam ,"I got a hole in my heart
Lord I gotta do some patchin'
Got the seven year itch, girl,
We gotta do some scratchin'

Lay down momma
Got a holy resurrection
You got the oo-ee baby
That's sweeter than confection

You don't need no invitation
Grab the devil by the tail
If you got the fascination
Touch it, touch it, touch it
Make it red hot!

Chorus:
Wham bam - it was better than the first time
Love jam - had my fingers in the pie
Wham bam - we were swingin' from the grape vine
Wham bam - and I kissed her butterfly

You got me climbin' up the walls
Gotta scrape me off the ceiling
Slow down baby
We don't want to blow the feeling
We got the fiy-aa
Like a burnin' volcano
I hope this feelin' never slips away
That is what I pray for

Yea, the train kept a rollin'
Screamin' all night long - Do it! do it!
We're gettin' down and dirty - do it! do it!"
212,What Could Have Been Love ,"I wake up and wonder how everything went wrong.
Am I the one to blame?
I gave up and left you for a nowhere-bound train.
Now that train has come and gone.

I close my eyes and see you, lying in my bed.
And I still dream of that day.

What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to me.
Didn't know, couldn't see.
What was right in front of me.
And now that I'm alone.
All I have is emptiness that comes from being free.
What could have been love will never be.

An old friend who told me that you found somebody new.
Oh, you're finally moving on.
Oh, you think that I'd be over you after all these years
Yeah, but time has proved it wrong.
'Cause I'm still holding on.

What could have been love 
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to me.
Didn't know, couldn't see.
What was right in front of me.(What could have been love)
And now that I'm alone.
All I have is emptiness that comes from being free.
What could have been love will never be.


We've gone our separate ways.
Say goodbye to another day.
I still wonder where you are.
Are you too far from turning back?
You were slipping through my hands.
And I didn't understand.


What could have been love
Should have been the only thing that was ever meant to me.
Didn't know, couldn't see.
What was right in front of me. (What could have been love)
And now that I'm alone.
All I have is emptiness that comes from being free.
What could have been love will never be.

213,What It Takes ,"There goes my old girlfriend, there's another diamond ring 
And, uh, all those late night promises I guess they don't mean a thing 
So baby, what's the story? Did you find another man? 
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made? 
When you don't look back I guess the feelings start to fade away. 
I used to feel your fire 
But now it's cold inside 
And you're back on the street like you didn't miss a beat, yeah 

Chorus: 
Tell me what it takes to let you go 
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go 
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night 
Without thinking you lost everything that was 
good in your life to the toss of the dice? 
Tell me what it takes to let you go. 

Yeah 
Girl, before I met you I was F.I.N.E. Fine 
but your love made me a prisoner, yeah my heart's been doing time 
You spent me up like money, then you hung me out to dry 
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise 
'Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes 

Chorus 
Guitar! 

Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone 
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch 
Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that much 
Tell me you ain't dyin' when you're cryin' for me 

Chorus 

Tell me what it takes to let you go 
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go 
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night 
Without thinking you lost everything that was 
good in your life to the toss of the dice? 
Tell me who's to blame for thinkin' twice 
No no no no 'cause I don't wanna burn in paradise

214,What Kind Of Love Are You On ,"You say one thing then you do another 
You got it all wrong so you blame it on your mother 
Your kicking the dog cause you can't get the cat 
You know it ain't cool but you like it like that 

Everybody talking bout what it is, what it ain't 
You kiss on the devil and you piss off a saint 
But it can't be love if you don't have to crawl 
You say you don't need nothing but you got to have it all 

I want to know 
What kind of love are you on

Choking on a lover like a brand new drug 
Do the same thing, every damn day

She charged his ass a quarter 
Well, he flipped his lid

Rocking in the cradle with a high school vamp 
Screaming at a homey like an old tube amp 
Up down, sideways, going in and out of things

I was as lonely as can be she had a beautiful *
She was lonely
She showed me her tattoo it was right there
On her breast
Somewhere in a city in the middle of the West

When she asked me to her house
Little did I know she was only
She was just 18 still livin' with her folks
She was only
And when I met her momma she undressed me
With her eyes
Then her daddy gave a look at me
That could have paralyzed

Chorus:
Cause your mamma wants to do me and your
Daddy wants to do me in
I'm a cat with nine lives I hope that I
Can make it to ten
O'cherry please forgive me for confessin'
My original sin
Because your mamma wants to do me
And your daddy wants to do me in!

Down the stairs, I had this deja voodoo
