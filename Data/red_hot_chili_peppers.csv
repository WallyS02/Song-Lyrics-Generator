0,21st Century ,"All the creatures on the beaches
Making waves in a motion picture

Won't you keep this in between us
Search and seizure wake up Venus

The dollar bill will mentally ill bill
Mom and dad take your  don't be sad  pill

Turn the screw and twist my language
Don't forsake me I'm contaigious


There's a reason
For the 21st century
Not too sure
But I know that it's 
Meant to be
And that it's meant to be

It's my favourite combination
Coming down with the favoured nations
Deep rotation mutilation
Learn to give and take dictation
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, like Cain and Abel
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, it's time to run this table


There's a reason
For the 21st century
Not too sure
But I know that it's 
Meant to be
And that it's meant to be

Read me your scripture and
Read me your scripture
Read me your scripture and I will twist it

Show me your wrist and I
Show me your wrist and
Show me your wrist and I'll kiss it kiss it

Oh, oh oh, oh oh, like a Cain and Abel
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, it's time to run this table

Simple soldier hand it over
Stop and read what you just wrote her

Strangulation altercation
Oral sex and bird migration


There's a reason
For the 21st century
Not too sure
But I know that it's 
Meant to be
And that it's meant to be

There's a reason
For the 21st century
Not too sure
But I know that it's 
Meant to be
And that it's meant to be"
1,A Certain Someone ,"When will it come around
The wind that.... will inspire

When will it make a sound 
The sound... I desire 

'Cause we all need something to do 
A certain something... that's true 

Floating upstream I've seen 
The spider and the snake 
A trip without pause when 
I saw... my mistake 

'Cause we all need something to do 
A certain something... that's true 

All my life... I have known who I am 
A troubled man but I stand 

All my life I have seen what it means 
To be myself in this dream 

'Cause we all need something to do 
A certain someone... that's you"
2,A million miles of water ,"Broke down 
I found 
Even when you think you need a rest 
You will live to fight another round 

I know it's 
Too bad 
So sad 
All the things that we could've been 
And could've had 

Hey girl what sound 
A million miles of water 
That are flowing deep 
Beneath this ground 
Now I found you 
Right here 
A million miles of water 

You were 
My muse 
Just because you happen to have a bomb 
Doesn't mean you light the fuse 

I know that 
Mad girl 
Big lie 
Four years in and 
You never even said goodbye 

Hey girl what sound 
A million miles of water 
That are flowing deep 
Beneath this ground 
Now I found you 
Right here 
A million miles of water dear 

Hey girl what sound 
I want you to remember that 
Sometimes we have to go without 
Now I found you 
Right here 
I want you to remember dear 

We were 
Two of 
A funny kind so damn blind 
But now we got to never mind 

I know that 
This is 
The end 
We tried so hard 
But now I got to lose a friend 

Hey girl what sound 
A million miles of water 
That are flowing deep 
Beneath this ground 
Now I found you 
Right here 
A million miles of water dear 

Hey girl what sound 
I want you to remember that 
Sometimes we have to go without 
Now I found you 
Right here 
I want you to remember that 

Hey girl what sound 
A million miles of water 
That are flowing deep 
Beneath this ground 
Now I found you 
Right here 

Hey girl what sound 
I want you to remember that 
Sometimes we have to go without 
Now I found her 
Out here 
I want you to remember that"
3,Aeroplane ,"I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane.
It's my aeroplane.
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane.
It's my aeroplane.
Pleasure spiked with pain.
That motherfucker's always spiked with pain.

Looking in my own eyes, hey Lord
I can't find the love I want.
Someone better slap me
Before I start to rust
Before I start to decompose.
Looking in my rearview mirror.
Looking in my rearview mirror.
I can make it disappear.
I can make it disappear, have no fear.

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane.
It's my aeroplane.
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane.
It's my aeroplane.
Pleasure spiked with pain.
That motherfucker's always spiked with pain.

Sitting in my kitchen, hey girl
I'm turning into dust again.
My melancholy baby,
The star of muzzy must
Push her voice inside of me.
I'm overcoming gravity.
I'm overcoming gravity.
It's easy when you're sad to be.
It's easy when you're sad...sad like me.

I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my aeroplane.
It's my aeroplane.
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane.
It's my aeroplane.
Pleasure spiked with pain.

Just one note
Could make me float
Could make me float away
One note from
The song she wrote
Could fuck me where I lay
Just one note
Could make me choke
One note that's
Not a lie
Just one note
Could cut my throat
One note could make me die

I like pleasure spiked w/ pain
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my aeroplane
It's my aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain

It's my aeroplane /x9"
4,Afterlife ,"Long live the king
The young grows old with his buffalo spring

I got a Tupelo and we're ready to go
We gonna hit it all night with the rock and a roll
And if I'm feelin' uptight, gonna leave it alone
We're gonna board up on the flight to the great unknown, well
That's all I'm saying now
Hear what I'm playing, yes
High on a light from above
You're somebody special, well
Someone to wrestle now
Take from the lake of your love

Long after we have been gone from this song
Well, the afterlife sings one for mе
Lost in the length of those warm-ass horizons
Thе afterlife knows where I'll be

We gonna get it up for the brotherly cup
And when I bring it on down with the Jamison Brown
Well, on a cold, cold night 'round a Baton Rouge
We gonna make it alright with Iggy the Stooge, well
Pull on my lever, it's
My guilty pleasure, yes
Born to live life on the run
Take from this river, and
Give to the ocean, yeah
They gave us more than enough

Long after we have been gone from this song
Well, the afterlife sings one for me
Lost in the length of those warm-ass horizons
The afterlife knows where I'll be

Long after we have been gone from this song
Well, the afterlife sings one for me
Lost in the length of those warm-ass horizons
The afterlife knows where I'll be
Long after we have been gone from this song
There will be something to see
My mother said there will be some surprises
The afterlife shows them to me"
5,American Ghost Dance ,"Oh give me a home
Where the buffalo roam
And the death of a race is a game
Where seldom is heard
A peacable word
From the white trash
Who killed as they came
Though these words dig deep
They offer no relief
God save the queen
I am an Indian chief
There is a secret I keep
It's called the talking leaf
And you better believe
That he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds
A sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of
A wounded knee creek

American ghost dance...

A new man who is with old ways
He walks the streets of life
But he's in chains
I'm alive he cried
I can feel the flame
Burning red inside
I am an Indian brave
There is a memory
That lives in my blood
Of the grand you laid
On all you touched
But the burning flame
Turns to burning pain
Genuine genocide
And that's truly insane
So like a wild hurricane
I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died
When it should have been saved

American ghost dance...

Oh give me a home
Where the buffalo roam
And the death of a race is a game
Where seldom is heard
A peacable word
From the white trash
Who killed as they came
Though these words dig deep
They offer no relief
God save the queen
I am an Indian chief
There is a secret I keep
It's called the talking leaf
And you better believe
That he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds
A sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of
A wounded knee creek

American ghost dance..."
6,Animal Bar ,"Never 21 when everyone's a sailor
Coming up strong at the animal bar
Ever loving mug of Mr. Norman Mailer
Turn another page at the animal bar
And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

I I I the cry of isolation
I I I the high of meditation
I I I for sweet precipitation
I I I the high of deprivation

And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
Runnin' through the mud
I gotta feeling of worth

All aboard the ship
'Cause you're gonna need an ark
When the wet comes down
You'll be swimming like a shark
Mopping up the stain and
I'm a little older
The song of rain
At the animal bar

And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

I I I the cry of isolation
I I I the high of meditation
I I I for sweet precipitation
I I I the high of deprivation

And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
Runnin' through the mud
I gotta feeling of worth

Raindrops will fall from the sky
Stealing their shape from your eye
Now we can all get some sleep
The water the water the water
Saving us from the heat

Some things will die in their place
Others will leave little trace
Fire will come find its day
The water the water the water
Washing it all away

Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
In between the sky and every piece of the earth"
7,Annie Wants A Baby ,"Lucy Rebar
She's a friend of mine
Later she'll go
Back and redefine the line
It's getting longer all the time
Oh Yeah

Drinkin' sunshine
She likes the taste of it
She had a gold mine
But then she wasted it away
You should have seen her yesterday
Oh Yeah

Sing along the way
Nothing stops the ache

Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Cosma shiva
Got off
Made you a believer
I don't need to
Tender
Why do I believe you
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby
Any way she can

Missing pieces
She's got a lot of them
Time decreases
I wish I thought of them - before
Before it's time
To close the store
Oh Yeah

Distillation
A lonely sycophant
Some liberation
The only CD
Ever played
I wanna help you
But I can't
No no

Sing along the way
Nothing stops the ache

Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Love 'em leave 'er
Got off
Made you a believer
Neon soldiers
Left her
Now you've gotten older
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby
Any way she can

It's getting longer all the time
It's time to redesing the sign
Oh Yeah
Sing along the way"
8,Apache Rose Peacock ,"Sittin' on a sack of beans
Sittin' down in New Orleans
You wouldn't believe what I've seen
Sitting on that sack of beans

Lunatics on pogo sticks
Another southern fried freak on a crucifix
Hicks don't mix with politics
People on the street just kickin' to the licks

Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Hanalei
Mentally or physically
I wanna be in the New Orleans

Oh good brother just when I thought
That I had seen it all
My eyes popped out, my dick got hard
And I dropped my jaw

I saw a bird walkin down the block
Name apache rose peacock
I could not speak I was in shock
I told my knees to please not knock

Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Hanalei
Mentally or physically
I wanna be in the New Orleans

A little boy came along
Name was Louis Armstrong
Said that girl who left me silly
She liked the looks of me and my willy

So I found her in the quarter
Good God how I adored her
Oh she made me feel so cozy
When she told me I could call her Rosey

I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You felt well in stormy weather
I never met a girl that I liked better

Twinkle twinkle little star
Shining down on my blue car
Drivin' down the boulevard
She was soft and I was hard

Apache rose gotta rockin' peacock
Hottest ass on the god damn block
Rockin' to the beat of the funky ass meters
She has one of those built in heaters

I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You felt well in stormy weather
I never met a girl that I liked better

Voodoo gurus casting their spells
Cockatoo drag queens shakin' their bells
Silver sound escapes the trumpet
Watch your leg someone might hump it

Chicken strut your butt let's rock
Gettin' it on under your frock
Flowing like a flame all through the night
My girl's insane but it's all right

Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Hanalei
Mentally or physically
I wanna be in the New Orleans"
9,Aquatic Mouth Dance ,"Looking back at the years gone by 
When The Message changed my life
Heavy metal the nest was dead 
Well and the rappers gave delight 
But I don't know who 
Was looking out 
For anyone like me and you 
Maybe it was Siouxsie Sioux

Day to day was the way we play 
Well everybody needs to eat 
Girl is gone and the front door too 
Well I guess we move our feet 
And I don't know why 
The color of your eyes 
Was stolen from the sky 
And earthquakes never need to lie

Aquatic mouth dance 
Is waiting for you 
Aquatic mouth dance
Is waiting for you now
Aquatic mouth dance 
Is waiting for you

Everyone and their best friend knew
That the west was overdue
Growing out of the fertile dirt
Well and the cracks were falling through
But I don‘t know what 
I'm looking for 
I only know the deepest cut 
It's coming from my gut

Parking lot of the old Starwood
Where the Misfits like to go 
Billy Zoom and his silver string 
Well it just might be John Doe 
And I don't know where 
I'm gonna sleep tonight 
Please tell me can you spare 
A pillow for my head and hair

Aquatic mouth dance 
Is waiting for you 
Aquatic mouth dance
Is waiting for you now
Aquatic mouth dance 
Is waiting for you

Pucker up for the hologram
I better find out who I am
Let it out with a downtown Scream
Because we need more space to jam
But I don't know how
To turn it down
I end up being so damn loud
Ah bend your brow, bend it now

Prototropical Sunday nights 
Smog flowers they don't bite 
Dirty skies never work so hard 
Better step to the Angels Flight 
And I don't know if
The embers of my burning flame 
Are from this spliff 
The greatest gift, the greatest gift

Peppered up
At the Cathay bash
With a 45 to split
Spilling beer is a good fountain
Like the milk from a mother's tit
But I don't know slow 
Someone has to come and teach me
Self-control
Or should I just say fuck it 
And we go"
10,Around The World ,"All around the world
We could make time
Rompin' and a stompin'
'Cause I'm in my prime

Born in the north
And sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for
The state of Pennsylvania

I try not to whine
But I must warn ya
'Bout the motherfucker girls
From California

Alabama baby
Said hallelujah
Good god girl

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do

Come back baby
'Cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world
Back from Bombay

Fox hole love
Pie in your face
Living in and out
Of a big fat suitcase

Bonafide ride
Step aside my Johnson
Yes I could
In the woods of Wisconsin

Wake up the cake
It's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when
When they do in Sicily

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do

Where you want to go
Who you want to be
What you want to do
Just come with me

I saw God
And I saw the fountains
You and me girl
Sittin' in the Swiss mountains

Me Oh My O
Me and Guy O
Freer than a bird
'Cause we're rockin' Ohio

Around the world
I feel dutiful
Take a wife
'Cause life is beautiful

I know I know for sure
(ring ding a do ring ding a ding ring dooooooooong ding dang)
I know I know it's you
(ring ding a do ring ding a ding ring dooooooooong ding dang)

Mother Russia do not suffer
I know you're bold enough
I've been around the world
And I have seen your love
I know I know it's you
You say hello then I say I do"

12,Backwoods ,"Someone spilled blood many years ago
Someone spilled blood but do you know
That from the backwoods
Where the chuck berrys grow
Come your long tall
Daddies of a rock and roll

Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now

Spinnin' down from the clouds
Like a tornado
Spinnin' out of control
Like a psychedelic soul
With a rhythm hittin' harder
Than Larry Holmes
Come your long tall
Daddies of a rock and roll

Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now

Mr uplift mofo - my man bo diddley
Hit sippin' a bottle of nickel ripple
Play the lickity split finger lickin licks
For all you wicked city sclick chicks
And all you nitty gritty hicks
We'll make your nipples ripple
Make you wanna dip your dipple
Make you wanna soak your hickory stick
That's right
Because my man has a grip on it
And I do mean on it
Which brings to mind
A very sinister minister kind of guy
A man named little Richard
Who was born to make them bitches stir
That's right he'll make the sweet substance drip
From the middle of your hillbilly lips
And like the farmer milks his cow
The howling wolf will howl
And since times does allow
You all can
Take me to your backwoods now

Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods"
13,Bag of Grins ,"In my day I could hear them say
Mr. K was awfully close
Now we take that bow you know
'Cause it's time to meet your ghost
And I don't understand
Minotaurs and jaguars
Are at my finger's tip
Falling up through the mustard gates
And I think I broke my hip
And I don't understand
I do not understand

Nine o'clock I turn my heels and sigh
For one last time
Ten-thirty I tied my chi
And died up on the vine

Send me out to the pasture, love
With a closet full of whips
The coroner spins with his bag of grins
And he's sewing up my lips
And I don't understand

Nine o'clock I turn my heels and sigh
For one last time
Ten-thirty I tied my chi
And died up on the vine
I diеd up on the vine

Suddenly whеn the moment comes
And it's harmony or rage
Flowers cry on the corpse of love
And it's time to turn your page

Mr. and Mrs. Au Contraire
I think they'll soon arrive
All the treasures you have saved
Your children now divide
And I don't understand
I do not understand
Nine o'clock I turn my heels and-

Suddenly when the moment comes
And it's harmony or rage
Flowers cry on the corpse of love
And it's time to turn your page

I am somewhere else my love
And I think you'll know just where to find me
Out in an interstellar place and there's
Nothing left here to define me
You are somewhere else good love
And this life of crime that's all behind me
We are all just space and love
And I think you'll know that's who designed me
I am somewhere else my love
And I think you'll know just where to find me
Out in an interstellar place and there's
Nothing left here to define me
You are somewhere else good love
And this life of crime that's all behind me
We are all just space and love
And I think you'll know that's who designed
Me"

17,Behind The Sun ,"One day while bathing in the sea
my talking dolphin spoke to me
he spoke to me in symphony
from freedom's peace beneath the sea
he looked to me eyes full of love
said yes we live behind the sun

Behind the sun

The sun goes up
and the sun gets down
but like the heart of the sun
my heart continues to pound

Now while I shower in the rain
I watch my dolphin swim away
the one who listens to the surf
can feel the pulse beat of the earth
and like my dolphin swims so free
the sun does swim into the sea

Behind the sun

An island flying through the sky
one day your son might ask you why
and if you son should be a girl
l she too might ask you of this world
the sun shines sweet upon your beach
and yes my dolphin loves to teach

Behind the sun

The sun goes up
and the sun gets down
but like the heart of the sun
my heart continues to pound"
18,Bella ,"She wants to live in LA
Come put your ash in my tray

Once upon a funky crime
We were standing in the line
And now we're walking Melrose down to Vine

Well, I was asking her to live on my farm
And she was telling me ""No, not today""
I was telling her to do no harm
And she was telling me she could not stay

She'd rather live in LA
Down in Marina del Rey

I love her, I need her
Can't stop until I feed her
I want her so badly
Hell no, my name ain't Bradley

I'd wash her and clean hеr
Please tell mе, have you seen her?
Outlast her, drive past her
Margarita gonna be my master

Bella cries and that's alright
She's weepin' on my shoulder again, well
Bella lies and that's my type, I
Wish that I could hold her
Bella cries and that's alright
She's leakin' on my shoulder again, well
Bella lies and that's my type, I
Wish that I could hold

She wants to live in LA
Where every dog has her day

Flip flops in the toaster now
Scotch tape on this broken vow
And wow, it's time to live without my puppy's child

I was askin' her to live in the sticks
And she was tellin' me there is no way
The cheeky monkey was an anarchist
And she was tellin' me she could not stay

She'd rather live in L.A
Down in Marina del Rey

I love her, I need her
Can't stop until I feed her
I wand her so badly
Hell no, my name ain't Bradley

Bella cries and that's alright
She's weepin' on my shoulder again, well
Bella lies and that's my type, I
Wish that I could hold her
Bella cries and that's alright
She's leakin' on my shoulder again, well
Bella lies and that's my type, I
Wish that I could hold

Out on the country road, I sold my Forty
This comeback episode, hold on, shorty
Yes, Frank Sinatra knows the summer wind will blow
And skinny mornings drop below

Sold my Forty 
To Northern Jordie
I'll tell you when I move 
To hell and then I'll prove
The violin said ""Oh woah, woah""
And now the moment, the one we notice
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Bella cries and that's alright
She's weepin' on my shoulder again, well
Bella lies and that's my type, I
Wish that I could hold her
Bella cries and that's alright
She's leakin' on my shoulder again, well
Bella lies and that's my type, 
I wish that I could hold Bella

Leakin' on my shoulder again
That's Bella
Bella, girl, alone I sing
My Bella
Weepin' on my shoulder again
Well, Bella"
19,Beverly Hills ,"Empty frame on the wall
Cat & mouse when you don't call
All I do is think of her
The TV screens picture's blurred

So take it away!
Take it away!

Every night the scene is set
I've got to drink to forget
I cannot incur this debt
Where's the gun?
Here's my head!

Let's go to the HongKong
Breaking glass at Madame Wong's.
getting drunk getting loose!

I just want some skank!
I just want some skank!

Let's go roll some fields, man

Every night would be so great
I'd take you home to meet mom & dad
And they'll be so glad
They won't think their boy's a fag
Then they'll go upstairs and go to bed

Beverly Hills, century city
Everything's so nice and pretty 
All the people look the same
Don't they know they're so damn lame

There she goes
In a three piece suit 
Spandex pants
Cowboy boots

I don't know what i'm gonna do
I don't know what i'm gonna do 
Maybe i'll have to move

20,Bicycle Song ,"Here she comes in a suit and tie
Shepard’s bush and a leopard’s pie
She marching to the funky beat of
James Brown and his dancing feet
Gonna set your fish on fire
Pistol whipping of desire
So please do not resist your fate
I’ll pick you up yes it’s a date

How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention
Sitting there in a silent movie
Beside the only girl who really ever moved me
Happy days but sad I’m facin
Heaven knows that I’m on the case
How could I forget to mention the bicycle

Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl I heard it first
The beauty of your verse

A sticky finger and a wicked taste
Gotta a lot of love and a lyrical case
Be sure to write it in your book
I promise not to look
Wanna smell your sunny face
Funny place but it’s never a waste
I’d hop this fence to make amends
I hope this movie never ends

How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention
Make it up makin you my business
A funny buttercup but I let her forgiveness
Happy days but sad I’m facin
Heaven knows that I’m on the case
How could I forget to mention the bicycle

Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl I heard it first
The beauty of your verse

Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl I heard it first
The beauty of your verse"

And I don't wanna be your friend,

22,Black Summer ,"A lazy rain am I
The skies refuse to cry
Cremation takes its piece of your supply
The night is dressed like noon
A sailor spoke too soon
And China's on the dark side of the moon

(Hit me now)

Platypus are a few
The secret life of Roo
A personality I never knew
(Get it on)
My Greta weighs a ton
The archers on the run
And no one stands alone behind the sun

It's been a long time since I made a new friend
Waiting on another black summer to end
It's been a long time and you never know when
Waiting on another black summer to end

Crack the flaming whip
Sailing on a censorship
Riding on a headless horse to make the trip

Been a long time since I made a new friend
Waiting on another black summer to end
It's been a long time and you never know when
Waiting on another black summer to end

I been waiting
I been waiting
Waiting on another black summer to end
I been waiting
I been waiting
Waiting on another black summer to end
I been waiting

Waiting on another black summer to end"

She's the mystic heat of the Bourbon street dream
She's just made out of flesh and bones
But let me tell you little boy
You better leave her alone

Leroy Brown thought he was bad too
'till she left him floatin' in the old bayou
She's the kind of girl
She's built like a bomb
She's the blackeyed blackeyed
Blackeyed blonde, Get down !

That blackeyed beauty with the golden crotch
French electric sex a cock shocking swamp fox
Heaten queen of sleeze she's hot to box
But let me tell you little boy
She'll clean your clock

A slick and sly spy
Stuck in the muck of the moat
Blew his mind to find a diamond in the boat
Double-o-dooms day for Mr. James Bond
She's the blackeyed blackeyed

In which two bodies float
Operatic by voice
A fanatic by choice
Aromatic is the flower
She must be moist

25,Blues For Meister ,"It's always half and half
I'm happy and I'm sad
Everything that's beautifull
Always kills me too
The highest I get up
Is the deepest I get down
You're up there with your life
That's why I gotta shout, shout,
...And then gotta shout, shout

Blues for Meister
You sweet little thing
Blues for Meister
I'm so sad I gotta sing
A cozy little kitty up
sittin' on the couch
Oh, kitty cat, oh, baby
I really miss you now
Well have some respect
For my cat
He got squashed by the wheel
Of a Cadillac
Well, me and my pussy
We lost our flow
Well, goodbye my little calico

Your food's still in the cupboard
Hangin' in its can
You used to love to eat it
Down
I'll always love you Meister
You were so good to me
There's nothing like you nowhere
As far as I can see"
26,Bob ,"Well, my friend Bob’s in jail today 
His girlfriend is too 
For stealing change for gasoline 

Nothing to do but rue 
Destroy the proof 
‘Cause there will never be another one just like you, no 
Bob… 

I met him on the boulevard, Hollywood and Vine 
He said “you’re gonna be a superstar” 
I said “that’s fine, sublime” 
He loved my crime 

But there will never be another one just like you, no 
Bob 
I never see you 
I never see you 
I never see you 

**something something** all thru the night 
Blackest flag at dawn 
A lust for life that kills itself before it gets too strong, that’s wrong 
Please be lifelong 

‘Cause there will never be another one just like you, no 
Bob… 
I never see you 
I never see you 
I never see you 

Killing yourself, that would be an awesome oath 
This song is so far away 
Remember the home and how they left us alone 
Remember our friendship 

Stealing everything in the store 
You know I want you to stay 
Remember the home and how they left us alone 
Friends fade away… 

Well, my friend Bob’s insane today 
I know I am too 
The mental patients laugh and cry 

Nothing to do but rue 
Destroy the proof
‘Cause there will never be another one just like you, no

27,Body Of Water ,"Show me a sign that I love you
Blow me a mind as you always do 
Remind me to tell you that I've come to 
Believe in the beauty, the power of you 
Woman, dissolve into the sea
The body of water is calling me
The God of my daughter is always free
There's nothing to solve and you're solving me

Chorus:
Ooh, I'm in your company
Ooh, body that's calling me
Ooh, I'm in your company 

Throw me a line I could use one
I special-design me 'cause I'm your son 
Two thousand below where I feel my love 
The body of water where I come from

Bridge:
I'm dreaming, got a reason to steal 
Fire from the other side out there
Formations flow like screams 

I'm made with a life to spare
Get the jizz, mr. sism? got a rythm 
Technology of a prayer 
Scientist to the prism of faith
And hope so I am there 
Baby I'm old, can you come here?
The science of love is becoming clear 
Invisible love with the color still 
I need to a place in the atmosphere 
And I may believe..."
28,Brandy ,"There's a port on a western bay 
And it serves a hundred ships a day 
Lonely sailors pass the time away 
And talk about their homes 

And there's a girl in this harbor town 
And she works layin' whiskey down 
They say ""Brandy, fetch another round"" 
She serves them whiskey and wine 

The sailors say ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl) 
""What a good wife you would be"" (such a fine girl) 
""Yeah your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea"" 
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit) 

Brandy wears a braided chain 
Made of finest silver from the North of Spain 
A locket that bears the name 
Of the man that Brandy loved

He came on a summer's day 
Bringin' gifts from far away 
And though he made it clear he couldn't stay 
No harbor was his home 

The sailors said ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl) 
""What a good wife you would be"" (such a fine girl) 
""But my wife, my lover, my lady is the sea"" 
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit) 

Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes 
As he told his sailor stories 
She could feel the ocean fall and rise 
She saw its ragin' glory 
Now he had always told the truth, lord he was an honest man 
And Brandy does her best to understand 
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit) 

At night when the bars close down 
Brandy walks through a silent town 
She loves a man who's not around 
She still can hear him say 

She hears him say ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl) 
""What a good wife you would be"" (such a fine girl) 
""But my wife, my lover, my lady is the sea"" 
(dooda-dit-dooda), (dit-dooda-dit-dooda-dit)

29,Brave From Afar ,"Brave from afar when I hold you for country
Saved by a star can I hold you to one thing
Do you feel safe when they tell you
They sell you
For your children
The shelter they’re buidlin’

Prime time the perfect crime
Bow my head the ax we grind
Ruse cruise P’s and Q’s
I got beat up by the evening news

Deep hits the media blitz
Lost my mind so keep my wits
Maintain the same old same
Goodbye shiz and so long game

Brave from afar…

Plain jane the big campaign
The last detail has been restrained
Fraud fraud the lightening rod
When you see the sign time go applaud

Brave from afar…"
30,Breaking The Girl ,"I am a man
Cut from the know
Rarely do friends
Come and then go
She was a girl
Soft but estranged
We were the two
Our lives rearranged
Feeling so good that day
A feeling of love that day 

(Chorus:)
Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
She meant you no harm
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
He loves no one else

Raised by my dad
Girl of the day
He was my man
That was the way
She was the girl
Left alone
Feeling the need
To make me her home
I don't know what when or why
The twilight of love had arrived"
31,Brendan's Death Song ,"If I die before I get it done,
will you decide
take my words and turn them into signs
that will survive.
Because a long time ago
I knew not to deprive.

It's safe out there and now you're everywhere,
just like the skies
And you are love,
you are the love supreme,
you are the rise
And when you hear this,
you'll know its your jam,
it's your goodbye.


Like I said
you know I'm almost dead,
you know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums,
he's gonna play my song,
to carry me along.

Like I said
you know I'm almost dead,
you know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away,
to where we all belong.

We all crossed
when we were feeling lost,
it's just the tide.
Katari cried
the day her lover died
she recognized.
Because he gave her
a life of real love,
it's no surprise.

The nights are long,
but the years are short,
when you're alive.
Way back when,
would never be again,
it was a time
It's gonna catch you,
so glad I met you,
to walk the line.


Like I said
you know I'm almost dead,
you know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums,
he's gonna play my song,
to carry me along.

Like I said
you know I'm almost dead,
you know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away,
to where we all belong.


Like I said
you know I'm almost dead,
you know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums,
he's gonna play my song,
to carry me along.

Like I said
you know I'm almost dead,
you know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away,
to where we all belong.

Let me live,
so when it's time to die,
even the Reaper cries.
Let me die,
so when it's time to live,
another son will rise.



Like I said
you know I'm almost dead,
you know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums,
he's gonna play my song,
to carry me along.

Like I said
you know I'm almost dead,
you know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away,
to where we all belong.

Like I said
you know I'm almost dead,

And if you want these kind of dreams

And all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East
At least it settles in the final location
It's understood that Hollywood
Sells Californication

To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin is this your chin
Or is that war you're waging

Marry me girl be my fairy to the world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard
It's Californication

Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
Cobain can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off  station to station
And Alderaan's not far away
It's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise
Control of population 
Everybody's been there and
I don't mean on vacation

39,Can't Stop ,"Can't stop addicted to the shindig
Chop top he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunct the pistol that you pay for
This punk the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East Side lovers living on the West End
Knock out but boy you better come to
Don't die you know the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burning so bright I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screaming in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers

The world I love
The tears I drop
To be part of
The wave can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you
The world I love
The trains I hop
To be part of
The wave can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snowcone
So smart she's leading me to ozone
Music the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight the gold of meditation
This chapter's going to be a close one
Smoke rings I know you're going to blow one
All on a spaceship persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love
The tears I drop
To be part of
The wave can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you
The world I love
The trains I hop
To be part of
The wave can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm passing out, win or lose
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
How about you
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
Right on cue

Can't stop addicted to the shindig
Chop top he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunkt the pistol that you pay for
This punk the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East Side lovers living on the West End
Knock out but boy you better come to
Don't die you know the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burning so bright I wonder what the wave meant 

Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get 2 maybe even 3 of these
Come from space to teach you of the Pleiades

Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read through"
40,Carry Me Home ,"Celluloid soldiers, come in from the rain
Murder my smile, but please, leave me my pain
All those good people, they don't even try
Stealing the truth while they pay for your lie
I'm about to lose the things I never saw before
You wanted me to know the ups and downs
Away we go to get another hit, the it
The blood that she's about to spit

You go your way and I guess I'll go mine
We'll both arrive at the vеry same time
Pleasе, give me your tired, give me your poor
Please, lift up your lamp, walk through this door

Kick down the doors that you don't understand
Please, don't lose sight of this generous plan
Blinded by prisms, we wind up in court
I'm folding chairs while you sold yourself short
She's about to redefine the way
Reminded me to say the other way was right
She's in a place to pray for me
And now we've got to flash the funky light
You've got your way and it seems I've got mine
Both gonna die at the very same time

Marry me, mama
That's someone to carry me home
Stick with me, girlfriend
I don't want to be here alone
Marry me, mama
That's someone to carry me home
Stick with me, girlfriend
I don't want to be here alone"
41,Castles Made Of Sand (Jimi Hendrix Cover) Lyrics ,"DOWN THE STREET YOU CAN HEAR HER SCREAM
""YOU'RE A DISGRACE""
AS SHE SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS DRUNKEN FACE
AND NOW HE STANDS OUTSIDE 
AND ALL THE NEIGHBOURS START TO GOSSIP AND DROOL

HE CRIES ""OH GIRL, YOU MUST BE MAD 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SWEET LOVE YOU AND ME HAD""
AGAINST THE DOOR HE LEANS AND STARTS A SCENE 
AND HIS TEARS FALL AND BURN THE GARDEN GREEN

AND SO CASTLES MADE OF SAND,
FALL IN THE SEA EVENTUALLY

A LITTLE INDIAN BRAVE WHO BEFORE HE WAS TEN
PLAYED WAR GAMES IN THE WOODS WITH HIS INDIAN FRIENDS
AND HE BUILT A DREAM THAT WHEN HE GREW UP 
HE WOULD BE A FEARLESS WARRIOR INDIAN CHIEF

MANY MOONS PASSED AND THE DREAM GREW STRONG UNTIL TOMORROW
HE WOULD SING HIS FIRST WAR SONG
AND FIGHT HIS FIRST BATTLE BUT SOMETHING WENT WRONG
SURPRISE ATTACK KILLED HIM IN HIS SLEEP THAT NIGHT

AND SO CASTLES MADE OF SAND
MELTS INTO THE SEA EVENTUALLY 

THERE WAS A YOUNG GIRL WHOSE HEART WAS A FROWN
BECAUSE SHE WAS CRIPPLED FOR LIFE AND COULDN'T SPEAK A SOUND
AND SHE WISHED AND PRAYED SHE WOULD STOP LIVING
SO SHE DECIDED TO DIE
SHE DREW HER WHEEL CHAIR TO THE EDGE OF THE SHORE
AND TO HER LEGS SHE SMILED 
""YOU WON'T HURT ME NO MORE""
BUT THEN A SIGHT SHE'D NEVER SEEN MADE HER JUMP AND SAY
""LOOK A GOLDEN WINGED SHIP IS PASSING MY WAY""
AND IT REALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO STOP
IT JUST KEPT ON GOING

AND SO CASTLES MADE OF SAND
SLIPS INTO THE SEA EVENTUALLY 
"
42,Castles Made Of Sand (Live) ,"Down the street you can hear her scream ""you're a disgrace"" 
As she slams the door in his drunken face 
And now he stands outside 
And all the neighbours start to gossip and drool 
He cries ""Oh, girl you must be mad, 
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"" 
Against the door he leans and starts a scene, 
And his tears fall and burn the garden green 
And so castles made of sand fall in the sea, eventually 
A little indian brave who before he was ten, 
Played wargames in the woods with his indian friends 
And he built up a dream that when he grew up 
He would be a fearless warrior indian cheif 
Many moons past and more the dream grew strong until 
Tomorrow he would sing his first warsong and fight his first battle 
But something went wrong, surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night 
And so castles made of sand melts into the sea, eventually 
There was a young girl, whos heart was a frown 
'Cause she was crippled for life, 
and she couldn't speak a sound 
And she wished and prayed she could stop living, 
So she decided to die 
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore 
And to her legs she smiled ""you won't hurt me no more"" 
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say 
""look a golden winged ship is passing my way"" 
And it really didn't have to stop, it just kept on going... 
And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, eventually"
43,Catch My Death ,"Death
Let me catch my breath
Let me see whats left
Let me see whats true
Do I really want to
Run from my depths
Will I have regrets
Will I ever find you
Will I ever find words
That give me motive to express

Bread
Will I go unfed
Will I be that who rushes on in
To where angels fear to tread
Was it me who bled
On the new death bed
And there is no fear
When you’re leaning on love
Those greatful dead

Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone I do
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know
The ending, the must

Chess, let me play my best
When I do regress, let it all unwind
‘Cause we’re never confined
To the board unless
Less I second guess
Look into the sky where we all comply
With something higher than the
Rest of my love, sail through

Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone I do
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know
The ending, the must

Sky all around
Fell to the ground
Now I’m a child
Stayed for a while

Flesh is it meaning less
But we all protest
To the last request
Is there anything you
Could now suggest
Did I do my best
Did I leave it better
Even though we look to be
Just mildly obsessed with you
Sail through

Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone I do
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know
The ending, the must"
44,Catholic School Girls Rule ,"Catholic school girls rule...
In the class she's taking notes
Just how deep deep is my throat
Mother Mary don't you know
She's got eyes like Marylin Monroe

Catholic school girls rule...

From the cross she's raised her head
This is what the sister said
Give no love until you're wed
Live no life until you're dead

The good books says we must suppress
The good books says we must confess
But who cares what the good books says
Cause now she's taking off her dress

Catholic school girls rule...

Lead us into temptation
We are pure divine creation
Talkin' about my generation
Injected with the seed of emaculation

47,Coffee Shop ,"I am just a lousy bum
Searching for the unknown crumb
The crumb the crumb
Something or someone to come
Come along ILLUMINATE my lust
Combust
Confucius might have been confused
And Buddha might have blown a fuse
I ooze the muse

Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot

Back and forth my body's jerking
Will to thrill will not stop working
Work and work
I'll take you on a honeymoon
Jumping on a bed in a hotel room
The room the groom

Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot"
48,Copperbelly ,"Anyone can see clearly you're made for this kingdom
Dancing on the cold roof while you're lemon tree cries
Anyone can see dearly that you've got to bring them all
Ever makin' of the bed with your enemy lines

Tread not away from your heart
Sweat not, right from the start
Copperbelly hidin' out there in every mirror
Copperbelly try to fill you with meaningless fear

Someone's in love with emotional pain
Keys to this kingdom that come with your name
I don't wanna go, she don't wanna know
Thеy don't wanna, so, so, so, so
Easy to need when it all needs the same

Coppеrbelly wanna tell you there's nobody out there
Take it on the chin as you look for the wind
Copperbelly wanna tell you that you'd better knock there
Copperbelly wanna sell you a tub full of gin

We all suffer our losses
We all know the bad break
Sleeping on the sled of this old western decline
Living in your head, taking way too much time

Someone's in love with emotional pain
Keys to this kingdom that come with your name
I don't wanna go, she don't wanna know
They don't wanna know, so, so, so, so
Easy to need when it all bleeds the same

Clockwork is orange and built for compression
Stumbling upstairs am I somebody who
Start work is free and so full of impressions
Abstraction face and I look just like you

Take me by my warm hand and I'll be there
I'll be in your evening chair"

You're just like (crosstown traffic)
So hard to get through to you

But darling, can't you see my signals turn from green to red?
And with you, I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead

51,Dani California ,"Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper and her mama was a hippie
In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world does your company take me for?

Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
Oh her merry way sayin' baby whatcha gonna
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five
Just another way to survive

[Chorus:]
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

She's a lover baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen her coming when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

[Chorus]

Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say say say...

Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota

Down in the Badlands she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast...

52,Dark Necessities ,"Coming on to the light of day we got
Many moons that are deep at play so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile
To see what it has to say
You and I both know
Everything must go away
What do you say

Spinning Knot that is on my heart is like a
Bit of light in a touch of dark you got
Sneak attack from the zodiac
But I see your fire spark
Eat the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
What do you say
Yeah

You don’t know my mind
You don’t know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design and
Tell the world that I’m
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Stumble down to the parking lot you got
No time for the after thought they’re like
Ice Cream for an Astronaut
Well that’s me looking for we
Turn the corner and
Find the world at your command
Playing the hand
Yeah

You don’t know my mind
You don’t know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I’m
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Do you want this love of mine
Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now
Do you want it all the time
But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now

Pick you up like a paper back with the
Track record of a maniac so I
Move it in and we unpack
It’s the same as yesterday
Any way we roll
Everything must go away, what do you say
Yeah

You don’t know my mind
You don’t know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I’m
Falling from the sky and
Dark necessities are part of my design"

little kids free spirits but
already tormented by our own hands
given to us by our parents we got together
and wrote on desks and slept in laundry
rooms near snowy mountains & slipped through
whatever cracks we can find minds altered
we didn't falter in portraying hysterical
and tragic characters in a smog filled
universe we loved the dirty city and the
journeys away from it we had not yet been
or seen our friends selves chase tails round
and round in downward spiral leaving trail
of irretrievable vital life juice behind still
the brothersbloodcomradespartnerfamilycuzz
was impenetrable
and we lived inside it laughing with no clothes
and everything experimental 'till death was
upon us in our face mortality and
lots of things seemed futile then but
love and music can save us and did while
the giant grey monster grew more poisoned
and volatile around us jaws clamping down
and spewing ugly shit around nothing
is the same so we keep moving.

Lookin' wild & got all drugged up

I'm a meth lab first rehab
Take it all off
And step inside the running cab
There's a love that knows the way

I'm the rainbow in your jail cell
All the memories of everything you've ever smelled
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go

(Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend)
Ooooh...
Don't forget me I can't hide it
Come again get me excited

I'm an inbred and a pothead
Two legs that you spread
Inside the tool shed
Now we know it all for sure

I could show you
To the free field overcome and more will always be revealed
Not alone I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go

(Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend)
Oooh...
Don't forget me I can't hide it
Come again get me excited

Ooooh...
(Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend)
Don't forget me I can't hide it
There's a match now let me light it

I'm the bloodstain
On your shirt sleeve
Coming down and more are coming to believe
Now we know it all for sure

Make the hair stand
Up on your arm
Teach you how to dance
Inside the funny farm
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go

I'll be there and tell me when you want to go
Come on then and tell me when you want to go
More will be revealed my friend"
60,Dosed ,"I got dosed by you and,
Closer than most to you and,
What am I supposed to do,
Take it away, I never had it anyway.
Take it away and everything will be okay...

In you a star is born and,
You cut a perfect form and,
Someone forever warm,

Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on. x2

Way upon the mountain where she died.
All I ever wanted was your life.
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide.
All I ever wanted was your life.

Show love with no remorse and,
Climb onto your seahorse and,
This ride is right on course.
This is the way I wanted it to be with you.
This is the way I knew that it would be with you.

Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on x2

Way upon the mountain where she died,
All I ever wanted was your life. 
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide.

62,Dreams of a Samurai ,"Standing naked in your kitchen
Feeling free that I could be alive
Clearly I'm a contradiction
Too young to be my wife

A peaceful storm is never hectic
Her mellow voice that I could be within
The uniform is anorexic
A jealous choice won't win

A metamorphosis samurai
Y'got a little lord fish and I don't know why I got a
Metamorphosis samurai

Paint your face cause I'm a black foot
I thought I counted up the fireflies
Close enough to get a good look
Time to mobilize

A metamorphosis samurai
Y'got a little lord fish and I don't know why I got a
Metamorphosis samurai

I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane

Taking acid in a graveyard
Stealing food to keep the night alive
Every day I try to play hard
Even with my lies

The day they found you on a tour bus
The news was barren as a desert bone
The tabloids made a kind of small fuss
A couple pictures shown

I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane

Slowly turning into driftwood
No one ever wants to die alone
Thinking that a pretty gift could
Make you less unknown

Dirty sneakers on the pavement
The brilliant features of a common man
See the miracle of your life
No one ever can

I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane

See the world go by
The changes that we entertain
I don't recall it all
Remember I have gone insane"
63,Easily ,"Easily let's get carried away
Easily let's get married today
Shao Lin shouted a rose
From his throat
Everything must go
A lickin' stick is thicker
When you break it to show
Everything must go

The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for

Calling calling for something in the air
Calling calling I know you must be there

Easily let's get caught in a wave
Easily we won't get caught in a cave
Shao Lin's shakin' for the sake
Of his soul-Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of
All the things that you own
Everything must go

I can't tell you who to idolize
You think it's almost over
But it's only on the rise
Calling calling
For something in the air
Calling calling I know you must be there

The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for

Throw me to the wolves
Because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky
Because I know I'm coming back

Shao Lin's shakin' for the sake
Of his soul-Everything must go

I don't want to be your little research monkey boy
The creature that I am is only going to destroy

Throw me to the wolves
Because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky
Because I know I'm coming back"
64,Eddie ,"Sailing the Sunset Strip
I'm a bit of a king
Granny would take a trip
I've been bending the strings
Got hammers in both my hands
Such a delicate touch
They say I'm from Amsterdam
Does that make me Dutch?

Please don't remember me
For what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me
Lord and children
Please don't remember me
It's only 1980, it's only 1983

Smoking the reefer
Feeling my own light
My brother's a keeper
I married a TV wife
The devil's Camaro
Parked in thе high school lot
A little sombrero
'Cause tеacher was way too hot

Please don't remember me
For what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me
Listen lord now
Please don't remember me
It's only 1980, it's only 1983

Tell my love ""But leave me never""
Can't complain about the weather
Snowing at the rainbow, have a ball
Cut my teeth down at the whiskey
GTOs tried to kiss me
One more song, they have seen it all

[Instrumental Interlude]

Please don't remember me
For what I did last night, oh
Please don't remember me
What'd I say lord?
Please don't remember me
It's only 1980, it's only 1983

Please don't remember me
For what I did with David
You know I'm talkin' David Lee
Am I ready?
Please don't remember me
For what I did last night, oh
I guess I played a Flying V

65,Emit Remmus ,"The California animal is a bear
Angeleno but the devil may care
Summer time to talk and swear
Later maybe we could share some air
I'll take you to the movies there
We could walk through Leicester Square
What could be wetter than
An English girl American man
Chorus:
London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right

Hesitate but don't refuse
The choice was yours but you said choose
The look she used was green and sharp
Stabbed that boy all in his heart
Come what may the cosmos will
Take me up and down on Primrose Hill
What could be wetter than
An English girl American man

Chorus

Cuss me out and it'll feel all right
It's all right now
Call me now use the satellite
It's all right
It's all right

Down and out and it'll sound all right
It's all right now
It's all right 

The California flower is poppy child
Felony sends me all the gold in your smile
Drift away from anyone you can
Nothing ever goes according to plan
Though I know that every river bends
Time to say hello to snow on the Thames
What could be wetter than
An English girl American man

66,Encore ,"Listen to the Beatles and the sound of laughing Ed McMahon, we got high
Educated by a world so full of self and lost in space, too much pride
Cosmonauts and dirty thoughts are juggling the juggernaut, Soviet Spy
Every now and then when I remember to befriend, the little things in life

Hey you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs for sure

Hold my hand
I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now

Later on I'll read to you the things that I've been needing to say goodbye
Walk away from mom and dad to find the love you never had, tell no lies
Carry on and write a song that says it all and shows it off 'fore you die
Take a little breath before you catch an early death there is so much sky

Hey you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs for sure

Hold my hand
I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now

Skinny brains and little stains upon your
Face teenage remains tell me more
Lifted in the fifties when you really rather drifted through time, let's soar

Hey you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs, for sure

Hold my hand
I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now"

68,Especially In Michigan ,"Life is my friend
Rake it up to take it in
Wrap me in your cinnamon
Especially in Michigan
....well I could be your friend

White clouds I'm in
A mitten full of fisherman
C'mon Huckleberry Finn
Show me how to make her grin
....well I'm in Michigan

Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck

A rainy Lithuanian
Who's dancing as an Indian
Painted in my tiger skin
Especially in Michigan

Double chins and bowling pins
Unholy Presbyterians
Land is full of medicine
I find it when I'm slipping in
....I'm into Michigan

The tainted new librarian
Who fainted when she tucked you in
Let's float away like zeppelins
On stoic gusts of Northern winds

Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck

Out on the farm we'll be
Swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten where
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck

Life is my friend
Underwater violins
Order now from Ho Chi Min
A porcelain that comes in twins
....when I'm in Michigan

Throw me in the looney bin
'Cause I can take it on the chin
The cleavage of your pillow skin
Is moving like a violin

Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck

Out on the farm we'll be
Swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten where
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck, oh yeah"

70,Even You Brutus? ,"God is good and fate is great
When it feels so strong it's hard to wait
You never know how it might unfold
Hearts to break and bodies to hold
Time will tell but it never gets old

Like I told you I'm in for the long, long…

Had to have been one of those things
That took place in outer space
A match made in heaven
Not a scratch on her face
Angels must have smoked some dust
Singing songs ‘bout in God we trust
Some things slide but this is a must

Like I told you there’s a time for finding out

People try to tell me what not to do
You shouldn't make it with a younger girl
Too many chances for the foot to drop
I tried to tell them that I found a pearl

Like I told you be careful what you’re asking for

Hey, sister Brutus
I’ve got a mess of a better half
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

She was the cutest thing that I ever did see
Drink in her hand and I don't mean tea
She was with a dude but I just didn't care
I had to find out these moments are rare
And Stevie says ‘All is fair’

Like I told you there is something for everyone

Well I guess I never told you some things
That I really really wanted to say
Did I do everything that I could do
Or did the mice just need to play

Like I told you there is more than meets the eye

Hey, sister Brutus
I’ve got a mess of a better half
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

I'm not trying to point fingers at you
And I'm not trying to lay any blame
But when it comes to the punishment
Girl you know how to bring the pain

Like I told you, I'd do it all again

Hey, sister Brutus
I’ve got a mess of a better half
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

Come on

Hey, sister Brutus
There's a fury to the woman's wrath
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back"

I was looking for the triple,
Never playing good defence.

We were gunnin’ for the glitter,
Every hot and heavy hitter,
She was never really there so I couldn’t really get her.

I said
Factually I, I’m just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it

Piece of work, I was really quite a jerk.
Keeping score is such a bore, a busy mind could go berserk
Oh feast on this, I was fishing for a hook
So I took a little trip, when I opened up the book

I said
Factually I, I’m just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Factually I, it's just the medicine
Make you wanna cry, why don’t they let us in?

Be my wife, I think you're right that we should mate

Crack your whip, she’s confessing from the hip
She was good at getting there, but not as much for round trip
Oh all this time, I was searching for a dream
I was slippin' in and out of every other sex machine

Factually I, I’m just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Factually I, it's just a medicine
Makes you wanna cry, why don't they let us in?

I read the news, it's all gone wrong
The facts of life have left too soon
The serving up doom and gloom
Never gonna leave my room
Black Capricorn will blow the horn
For all the love that can't be born today
Everybody walk away

Set 'em on up to knock 'em all down
And take me to your leader where the make up
Is fake as fuck
Strap it on in to map it on out
Spin doctors wanna makе you think you're straight up
Just out of luck
Set 'em on up to knock 'еm all down

Friday afternoon is cool
I lost my faith in Sunday school
Deliver me from Liverpool
I feel just like an April fool
Someone's gotta break the rule
Sticking to the script
We built another sinking ship
She's so alone
Never gonna leave my home
Mother nature can't go wrong
The science God's forever strong
A-floating in a great beyond
And everybody sing along
Everybody rock that song

Strap it on in to map it on out
Spin doctors wanna make you think you're straight up
Just out of luck

I'm a lonely, lonely lord
Searching all night for the wrong reward
An appetite that's running on all fours
Misdirection waves its wand
Turning my head from black to blonde
Like a queen will now become the pawn
Busted on a ship gone, take me home
Mother named faith, made lightning comes
Busted on a ship that's sailing through the foam
I'm a lonely, lonely lord
Pick another day to be restored
Just another fate that's going overboard"

Comin' from her heart
Get lost and wet

Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah

Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah

We were moving in the world, expanding your realities
A force of nature on the verge, commanding abnormalities
Last thing I remember there was ringing in my selfish ears
Twenty-Six a number much too small for someone's golden years

You give a little bit for your brother's kind

You sign a little bit stronger when you
Remember the song of your old best friend

or from a park bench
you could be a politican
or a bitchy princess
but if you're lookin' for a fist

you know the lie is dead

get if off your chest
get it out your arm

and you're running afraid
you say you ran across the planet
but you couldn't get away
the fire in your brain
was driving you insane
you were looking for a day
in a life that never came

I've got to take a number
cause I've been to that doctor
and believe me that's a bummer
here's a one of a kind
convention of the mind

Don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel

Chester ring down and a wind don't fly down
Pip-de-whip and then-a oh snap

Open my goldmine and there for a soul inclined and
Said that out of sight is right beside

Sometimes there's a reason to shine
You beside, oh
Sometimes there's a man on the pines
Tell me now

Ah-oh he said I'm-a right to goldmine
Let know that him the way I know
Lie like here through the night
Slide on in on a slide

You decide, all alone

through the world of song our boldness is exposed

Our devotion to emotion is more than evident
to the minds that are open it's you we represent
we hope you have enjoyed the time that you have spent
one day the good time boys that might jest be president

Like a pack of mad hatters who come from outer space
our swinging's gonna shatter every stone cold face

Now you may not know the exact reason why
a band commands attention from the mountains and the sky
makin' more that money more than money can buy
I stop! and take a listen to the monsters try

'cause his heart is made of glory and his voice is made of gold
he'll tell you in a minute about the men he knows
he'll tell you 'bout the band called fire hose

To those of you who doubt the nature of our spirit
we play it out loud for everyone to hear it

Building up our brains with the supernatural powers
we take it from the trees and the mighty watts towers
aim the flame of freedom at the lames and sours
we're the best of the west and the west is ours

give me good times yea yea yea yea 

Good good time boys make me feel good
give me good times yea yea yea yea"

Deep regrets, I never could forget you
Somehow you made your way to my decade
Ayo ayo ayo ayo my girl

In the sun, I see you with your guard down
Number one, you're moving to a hard town
Do not dismiss the promise that you made me
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time

Overkill you took another red pill
On the sheet is everything that you spilled
We are the ones you want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, black light

Come again to murder your report card
Just a friend to kiss you in the court yard
You are the one I want to be stuck with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo big fight

Favor Some
Way too young
Slave to none
Way too young

Say goodbye my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

Sticky fingers find the way to take her
Crumple up another piece of paper
I know your days are numbered when it comes to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo this life

Slip away into the solar system
Straighter rays, you find a way to twist them
Some like it dark and now I know where to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo find you

Serpentine, I think she was an Aussie
Bloody hell, a common kamikaze
Give up the ghost before you go under
Ayo ayo aye ayo wonder

Kicking hard and looking for a rescue
Watch me starve was never to impress you
I would have killed the part of me to have you
Ayo ayo ayo ayo story

Say goodbye my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail

Babe I know love is a funny thing
Born to die in the eternal spring

Your flickering is more than just a small flame
Welcome to the party, it's a ball game
Pick up the stick it's time to get hit with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo my bat

Suicide is never going to save you
When I cried, it was because I came too
You are the one I want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo kiss this"
94,Goodbye Hooray ,"Junior pimp at the old cafe
Got to chase those girls around
Westbound, drunk with lots to say
But he never makes a sound
Hustlers get what they deserve
But it's always half the gate
Good things come to those who wait
Like an expiration date

See you around I'll see you around
I'll play all night
Can't get uptight
I'll lead all your mind games astray
See you around I'll see you around
I'll play all night
Can't get uptight

Curb your tongue oh scallywag

Save your breath for the black and white
Every dog will have his day

95,Green Heaven ,"About this planet, there is something I know
There's a very big difference between above and below
A friend foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow

Here, above land, man has laid his plan
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan
We got a government so twisted and bent
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution
If you think you're just away, you're in a mental institution
And that's a heart felt shame
'Cos everyone's crazy, everyone's the same
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?

Time now to take you to a different place
Where peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space
A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace
A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none
'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun
No one tells 'em how their life is run
And no one points at them with a gun
They have a lot of love for every living creature
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature
They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you

Back to the land of the police man
Where he does whatever he says he can
Including hating you because you're a Jew
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new
Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all
They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail
So support your police, support your local wars
That's the way to open economic doors
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore
We assume the position to sell the ammunition
What the fuck? It's the american tradition
Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?"
96,Greeting Song ,"Drivin' around I've got my baby and my top down
Mary-go-round I ride you for my love
Throwin' me down in the backseat underground
I'm on the mound I make it for my love

Makin' my way I brake another L.A. day
Time in the town I need it for my love
My Chevrolet rollin' to another play day
This is the sound I listen for my love

Who, you talking to, talk to me you
Sound of music (repeat 1x)

I love you swim through me
Good feelings come to me

Sought and I found a life of makin my bloodsound
Do anything for the one I love
Something profound the face of God is in sensoround
I'm on the mound I make it for my love

Who, you talking to, talk to me you
Sound of music (repeat 1x)

I love you swim through me
Good feelings come to me (repeat 2x)

Another day and another high
I walk around like I am on the ray
Somewhere way in the rays of Hanalei

I met a girl and I liked her vibe
Another day and another ride
I met a girl who wants to save the world
Make it safe
For someone else to find their faith

I’m away I’m away Hanalei

A simple song and it made me cry
I really don’t want to pass me by
A simple song that spoke of Hemmingway
The revolution in your blood
Creates the wave

I picked her up on the road to surf
Looked a lot like a mother earth
She said hello my name
Is Charlotte Gray, hey
Make it safe
For someone else to find their faith"

Handful of love when it's time to get older, yeah

There's a chapter in my book that I don't want you read
There's a chapter in my life where I failed to succeed
I wanna take your smell inside my dirty mind
You put a spell on me, no, I'm not the dying kind

Someone to roll me right over
Handful of love when it's time to get older

Someone to love for the rest of your days
Out on the road
Sky turns to water and night into days
Someone to hold

I need to see you comin' 'round my front door
It don't matter why, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, it don't matter what for
Let's turn your body into a drive-in movie screen
You can shoot 'em all down so they won't steal my dream

Someone to roll me right over
Handful of love when it's time to get older

Someone to love for the rest of your days
Out on the road
Sky turns to water and night into days
Someone to hold

I wanna splash a little love on your face
You fill me right up while you put me in my place
God only knows what she's got up her sleeve
And God only goes to the places that we need

Someone to roll me right over

Someone to roll me right over

106,Hometown Gypsy ,"Drivin' up the coast 
To find a version of the truth
Left the backdoor swinging 
Like a dirty little sleuth

The truth is I have never 
Felt half this alive
Now it's time to dance 
Upon the grave called 45

Jacked up on some Kerouac 
And surely bullet proof
The girl who taught me what to do 
Was missing her front tooth

Gentle as a storm 
Inside your mental health
I wanna find the answer 
But I just can't find myself

I say so long 
To the way I played
The way I played 
Inside of yesterday
Hey let's run around
The great escape 
From out of my hometown

Later I would look for love 
Inside a woman's dorm
A couch to keep me humble 
And her breath to keep me warm

Ophelia was the girl 
That I was feeling for
Come to realize 
It was me who was the whore

A captain lost himself 
Inside a 40 year old skull
The drink of choice was knowledge 
And we always wanted more

Drunken sailors 
Seeking their Geronimo
Instead they found the things 
That they really didn't wanna know

I say so long 
To the way I played
The way I played 
Inside of yesterday
Hey let's run around
The great escape 
From out of my hometown

Country roads 
Would never let me stay
The way I played 
Inside of yesterday

A devil's growl and cat's meow 
Were blended into one
Termites called suburbanites 
Were eating all the fun

A juggernaut of comedy 
And blasphemy
I wanna stop the madness 
But I think it has to be

I say so long 
To the way I played
The way I played 
Inside of yesterday
Hey let's run around
The great escape 
From out of my hometown

(Added to final song)
Country roads 
Would never let me stay
The way I played 
Inside of yesterday

Hey let's run around
The great escape 
From out of my hometown"
107,How It Ends ,"Love is all the world
You say the world is gone
Love is all the world
You say it's gone
I don't

The party in your eyes
Says someone to caress
A party in the sky
I think I'll wear a dress

God saves us all and tell us how it ends
Laugh till we fall so why can't we be friends

Mother taught me what to do in cocktail times
Work and play all day until the sun is high
Haley and the comets sang an old rock jam
The ukulele play another song I'll brag

God saves us all and tell us how it ends
Laugh till we fall so why can't we be friends

Stole a lot from Peter
Cause had to pay your Paul
And when you find that's not enough
He'll break your fall

Some get on and some
Get off the carousel
I think it's time to go
So I will fare thee well

God saves us all and tell us how it ends
Laugh till we fall so why can't we be friends

Stole a lot from Peter
Cause had to pay your Paul
And when you find that's not enough
He'll break your fall"

How strong is my love?

Rest a while to kiss your smile
Laugh and roll and after a while
I'll begin to like your style

(bridge:)
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?
She turned me down this time she
She turned me down
Lord, I can't believe she
She turned me down
She turned me inside out she
She turned me down
All I ask of you
Is turn me up this time

Come on over show me yours
Your glow soul I do adore
I'll be sure to drop my guard
And give it up it's not that hard

Darker than the darkest night
Living hell and pollocks at you
Getting new down on your back

How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?"

110,I Could Die For You ,"Something inside the cards
I know is right
Don't want to live
Somebody elses life
This is what I wanna be
And this is what I give to you
Because I get it free

I could die for you
Oh this life I choose

I'm here to be your only go-between
To tell you of the sights
These eyes have seen 
What I really want to do is
Turn it into motion
Beauty that I can abuse
You know that I'd use my senses to
You can see that
It's only everywhere
I'd take it all and then
I'd find a way to share

Come along and go
Along with me
Wander with me Yo
It's all for free

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh this life I choose

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh this life I choose

Come again and tell me
Where you want to go
What it means for me
To be with you alone
Close the door and 
No one has to know
How we are

Come along and go
Along with me
Wander with me Yo
It's all for free

I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh this life I choose

I could die for you

My face will never show
What is not real

A mountain never seems to have
The need to speak
A look that shares so many seek
The sweetest feeling
I got from you
The things I said to you were true

I could never change
Just what I feel
My face will never show
What is not real

I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never never never
Keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

But now she's gone yes she's gone away
A soulful song
That would not stay
You see she hides 'cause she is scared
But I don't care
I won't be spared

I could have lied I'm such a fool

Keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how

You want to get your look out

She took her little book out

I'm steady loving on the
Lady of these pages
Another chapter if you will
So ?

Down on the river tonight
Take off your glassess and fight

Under the heliomoon i'm
Going to pop the culture
Blue cherry dress on you
Is looking like a sculpture

This recreation is amusing
And confusing
You never knew that it
Could feel so good while losing

(What you lose, your virginity)

Down on the river tonight
Take off your glassess and fight

I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliment
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow

My intuition was a
Poppin' and a shakin'
The very thought of it was
All too much to take in

Curl up with lover we
Could lie out on the blanket
This canopy above i'll
Take the time to thank it

Down on the river tonight
Take off your panties and fight

I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliment
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow

I want to bury my face
Deep in your aroma
Her name is Lisa but
They call her Desmadona

Come out and see me for
Some street comunication

What to do
If I were the wiser of the two.

And if I saw it all so clear

We could take a walk into the
Canyons of the fifth avenue
Sing and dance
Just to name a few.

All I do
All I do

And if I heard the Angels sing I'd
Sing it back to you and bring the
Sound of heaven ringing just for you

And if I saw the sun fall down
I'd pick it up and make a crown
One that was a perfect fit for you.

We could take a walk
Into the apple orchard by the school
We could make a little residue

We could find a place to stay
A secret little hide away
Spend a little time inside of you

All I do
All I do

All eyes
All eyes

All eyes on you

All I do
All I do

Thinkin' he's a wise guy
Rob another bank
He's a sock 'em in the eye guy
Tank head
Mr. Bonnie and Clyde guy
Look him in the eye
He's not my kinda guy
Never wanna be
Confusion proof
Pudding's sweet
But too aloof
Orange eye girl
With a backslide dew said
Yo homie
Who you talkin' to
A backed up paddywagon
Mackin' on a cat's ass
One upper cut
To the cold upper middle class
Born to storm
On boredom's face
And a little lust
To the fucky ass flea bass
Most in the race
Just lose their grace
The blackest hole
In all of space
Crooked as a hooker
Now suck my thumb
Anybody wanna come get some

(Chorus:)

If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go

Don't ask me why
I'm flyin' so high
Mr. Bubble meets superfly
In my third eye
Searchin' for a soul bride
She's my freakette
Soak it up inside
Deeper than a secret
Much more
Than meets the eye
To the funk
I fall into my new ride
My hand my hand
Magic on the one
Is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few
Taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face
Like a stage on vaudeville

I feel so good
Can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum
Rockin' my red hood"
121,If You Want Me To Stay ,"If you want me to stay
I'll be around today
To be available for you to see
I'm about to go there
Then you'll know
For me to stay here
I've got to be me
You'll never be in doubt
That's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days I'm gone
Forget reachin' me by phone
Cause I promise
I'll be gone for a while
And when you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person
That you really are now
You got to get it straight
How could I ever be late
When you're my woman
Taking up my time
Oh how could I ever allow
I guess I wonder how
I could get out a pocket for fun
When you know that
You're never number two
Number one's gonna be number one

I'll be good
I wish I could
Get this message over to you now

When you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person
That you really are now
I'll be so good
I wish I could
Get this message over to you now

Get this message over to you now
I'll be so good
I wish I could"
122,In Love Dying ,"In love dying
There’s a flawless rain
In love dying
One foot in the astral plane
Someone’s sighing
There’s a virgin road
Waiting to be strode
Rope’s untying
This power I could not withhold

Satisfying
What do we contain
Can’t stop crying
These tears of change
Remain the same

My girl she shoots down
The baddest of guys
She knows that they
Want me dead
She fires up the starry night
And fills them so full
So full of lead

In love dying
Does it go two ways
In love dying
This body I can not detain

Wake up flying
She the solar shores
Passers buying
The memories we readorn

In love dying
Nothing to obtain
In love dying
No crawling thru
The halls of fame

In love dying
Loss becomes the gain
In love dying
Recreate me
So I may sustain"
123,In the snow ,"My mates have all gone married now
Off living in a kindred cloud
I'm not that kind
They cuddle up with kitten's bone
They puddle in their beds at home
I still can't find

Tell me what you want to see
Tell me what you want
And I'll take my time
And I'll move it forward
Do you want to come with me
Do you want to come
And I'll take my time
And I'll move it closer now

I check my stupid phone again
No matter that it's 4 am
It burns my eyes
A spotlight born to shine at night
Come what may it always might
Burn so bright

Tell me what you want to see
Tell me what you want
And I'll take my time
And I'll move it forward
Do you want to comе with me
Do you want to come
And I'll take my timе
And I'll move it closer now

Slow rodeo
Roll over, roll over
Slow rodeo in the snow
Slow rodeo
Hold over, roll over
Slow rodeo in the snow

High-waisted, she tasted like a salacious confrontation salvation
From the salivating demarcation of Columbian incarnation of the patron saint of palliation
Her milk framed and rose satin, untamed by the silk
That framed her Manhattan trap door which became duly unbattened
She's Latin, out cattin'

Does everything that feels so nice
Come with an inverted price
I still don't know

The ball is clearly in my court
And I am happy to report
It's moving slow

Tell me what you want to see
Tell me what you want
And I'll take my time
And I'll move it forward now
Do you want to come with me?
Do you want to come?
And I'll take my time
And I'll move it closer now

Slow rodeo
Roll over, roll over
Slow rodeo in the snow
Slow rodeo
Hold over, roll over

Of a humbling Colombian
Two socks and a tumble in her slumber skin
The summer wind, we crumble some
The rock and rumble of a tumbling bubblegum
Some other umbrella trellis forgot to tell us that the mellow tangelo is jealous
For the various and not necessarily contrary shell show
She said, ""Hell no""
The cock bottom temple varies like autumn lights soft the cost
The Fibonacci lost her sauce
Into the last remaining hostage boss, sweet toss
Now I lay me down to reap the sleep of your selective sedative
Repetitive
An uncredited she comes well-vetted
Gracefully and studied
Blue steadiness
The wrath, the math
The not yet fractured tabernacle of the Basil Rathbone
And the last disaster casting
Impassible laughter blocks my path
Blue chaff
Blue chaff
Blue chaff"
124,It's Only Natural ,"[Zwrotka 1]
She was a London girl
Knew enough now to get herself alright
He was a Southend boy
Not enough smile, but he sure could fight
She was a daddy's girl
Pride of all Brixton with dragon sight

But she can't go home tonight

[Refren]
It's only natural
And lovers will show you how
To break it down
In spite of attraction, well
It's only natural
And people will show you how
To take it down
In spite of your love, steady up

[Zwrotka 2]
They were a perfect pair
A clash of two beauties and the rash of vein
Nobody knows just when lightning will strike
But it always came
[Pre-Chorus]
And she can't go home tonight
No, she can't go home tonight

[Refren]
It's only natural
And lovers will show you how
To break it down
In spite of attraction, well
It's only natural
And people will show you how
To take it down
In spite of your love, steady up

But she can't go home tonight

[Refren]
It's only natural
And lovers will show you how
To break it down
In spite of attraction, well
It's only natural
And people will show you how
To take it down
In spite of your love
It's only natural
And lovers will show you how
To break it down
The perfect subtraction, well
It's only natural
And people will show you how
To take it down
In spite of your love, steady up"
125,Joe ,"Burning up your hometown streets could set a fire for the world to catch 
Burn it up, no need to reconcile 

Come and see me, I'm your west end perfect stranger, in America 
Lady on that state's so full of style 

Stand up, turn around, beat it out 
You gotta sound, Joe 
Swing low and now I know
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe

The many boots that you have laced could tell a story, comin' night and day (?) 
No one said that you would need a crowd

The many lands that you have graced could make a case that there is no better make
And now I only see your face in clouds 

Stand up, turn around, beat it out 
You gotta sound, Joe 
Swing low and now I know
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe 

Stand up, turn around, beat it out 
You gotta sound, Joe 
Swing low and now I know
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe 

Tell me so (?) 
Do you know 
Does it show 
When I'm low 

And then again, when I feel your love from far away, I think of yesterday 
I see a family we know how to smile 

There comes a time when you must rock another world and we will get along 
There comes a time when we will walk that mile 

Stand up, turn around, beat it out 
You gotta sound, Joe 
Swing low and now I know
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe 

Stand up, turn around, beat it out 
You gotta sound, Joe 
Swing low and now I know
It's hard to let a brother go, Joe"
126,"Johnny, Kick A Hole In The Sky ","I cry, I cry
I was born in a land, I don't think you understand
God damn, what I am
I'm a native of this place, please don't kick me in my face
My race has been disgraced

Won't somebody testify, kick a hole right in the sky
Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky, Johnny,
Johnny, Johnny

Put us in a pumpkin shell, where you keep us very well
It's hell, where I dwell
When history books are full of shit, I become the anarchist
I'm pissed at this
What this country claims to be
It's a lie
No place for me
I bleed

Won't somebody testify, kick a hole right in the sky
Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky, Johnny,
Johnny, Johnny

Kill my trust, if you must
But in my blood, there is lust
For life
That's right
Apache blood is in my heart, thrashing through me like a shark
Crashing through the dark

Won't somebody testify, kick a hole right in the sky
Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky, Johnny,
Johnny, Johnny

What am I supposed to do
I feel like I'm cut into confused
By rules
Do these two cultures clash or am I living in the past
I ask, please tell me fast

Won't somebody testify, kick a hole right in the sky
Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky, Johnny,

To what do I belong and if I change will I be wrong
I took my foot and kicked a hole in the sky
I proceeded to plead what fathers help me decide
A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye
I turned around and found that I was still alive
Snakes rise high from the purple black sky
The red cloud rains and the black horse rides
Then it dawned on me like the mornin' sun
I'm a part of two worlds and the mornin' comes
Glowing embers tend to remember when
The power that is peace was treated as a friend
I am a master of and i've got to take action
I'm a man, the animal man"
127,Jungle Man ,"Deep inside the soul hole
Of Mother Earth
Father Time came
With a supersonic supersonic burst
His soul monkey sperm tribes
Racing to be first
Her ruby fruit jungle
Givin' bush baby bush baby birth
The baby was a boy
But I think what stunned her
Is that this bare breasted baby
Was a baby boy boy boy boy wonder
Crackin' from his thumb bone
Came thelonious thunder
Fill the sky with hellfire
From way down down down under


I am a jungle man 
I am a jungle man 
I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can


Erupting from the ground
In hollywood he glowed
His jungle turned to concrete
His funk bone bone bone bone to stone
Like a full blown volcano
I must let it be known
That through this boy's vein
Atomic lava blood flows and flows
His soul shocking sounds
They make the mountains moan
This boy's become a man
It's time to take take take
Take the throne


I am a jungle man
I am a jungle man 
I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can"
128,Kaly ,"I'm a lunatic, and a hypocrite
A lone star gone lost in vain
I'm a Kerouac, and a gunnysack
A fringe mad lad pre-ordained

You don't have to pretend, friend
Darlin', what you feel
A message that we want to send
Along the glockenspiel

I'm a soft-tooth, and the cold truth
A heart slap through your wet man brain
I'm a biker's boot, and a nudist suit
A dirty member of the Golden Chain

But on the bright side, there's a reason that we all must come to lose
On the bright side, I've got you
Well, on the bright side, there's a reason that we all must come to bleed
On the bright side, you've got me

I'm a black fish, how to speak your wish
A mad tax that we all pay
I'm a medical, so theoretical
A lover's bed with another stain

You don't have to pretend, friend
Darlin', what you feel
A message that we recommend
No matter what we steal

But on the bright side, there's a reason that we all must come to lose
On the bright side, I've got you
Hit me, faker
Well, on the bright side, there's a reason that we all must come to bleed
On the bright side, you've got me

Hold in your words
The things I've heard are so absurd, can we go far beyond the curve
The sight that we choose
We don't ever want to be afraid to win, afraid to lose

But on the bright side, there's a reason that we all must come to lose
On the bright side, I've got you
But on the bright side, there's a reason that we all must come to bleed
On the bright side, you've got me
Listen to me, love

On the bright side, there's a day you come to find me in your hands
On the bright side, I'm your man"
129,Kill For Your Country ,"Overshot my mark and
Put'em down on the ground, fall away 

No one is quite so different 
Evil, good, understood, enemy

The king and queen were sleeping
Industry, ecstasy, sympathy
Sympathy

I'm leaving home today 
I thought about and I want to say 
I will miss this land and it's promise 

I'm sticking next to you 
Big amigo is it really true 
When they say you should kill for your country 
Kill for your country 

I've got three kids to feed 
A fine woman and a need to speed 
Far away from this land and it's promise 

I wave goodbye to you 
And the peace that I wish I knew 
Time to leave and go kill for my country 
Kill for my country 

Put 'em down and hold your fire 
Command that world that we inspire 
Put 'em down and hold your fire 

Set'em up with quick release 
This world of ours, this land of frees 
Set'em up with quick release 

Overshot and made a mess
This world is cold and I'm under-dressed
Overshot and made a mess

We consume and we digest 
This world is born on a dead men's chest 
We consume and we digest 

Mow'em down, mow'em down 
Hold your fire, hold your fire 
Mow'em down, mow'em down 
Hold your fire, hold your fire 

This is a message to you 
This is a table for two 

Mow'em down, mow'em down 
Hold your fire, hold your fire 
Mow'em down, mow'em down 
Hold your fire, hold your fire

I could not make it alone
Step up 'cause you stopped the throw"
130,Knock Me Down ,"Never too soon to be through
Being cool too much too soon
Too much for me too much for you
You're gonna lose me in time

Don't be afraid to show your friends
That you hurt inside inside
Pain's part of life don't hide behind your false pride
It's a lie your lie

If you see me getting migh
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life /x2

I'm tired of being untouchable
I'm not above the love
I'm part of you and you're part of me
Why did you go away?

Finding what you're looking for
Can end up being being such a bore
I pray for you 'most every day
My love's with you now fly away

If you see me getting migh
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life /x8

Life so hard that think we'll rue
I'll fuck up and get so mad

Whistle when you want me there

Give me your honey
And I won't spend it in one place
Bended knee to get a taste

I wanna spend my wheels with you
When I lose some deals with you
Tell me how it feels for you
To order Happy Meals for two
And when it all seems out of reach
We'll clean up plastic off the beach

You'll be Chong and I'll bе Cheech

Indonesia, that's my groove
It doesn't matter where we move
I lost you at the Vegas Louvre
But we don't need no rings to prove
Crippled by some looping fields
The ripples of a lost career
Phone call from a financier
And no one lives like no modelier

Bended knee to get a taste

Knock 'em dead a' covered in flies
The big sleep without a bed of roses
The light of day will never tell lies

All the mothers come undone
At the sight of me

I think I'll kiss my shame away
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
I think I'll kiss my shame away

Let's get hard
Let's get off in my backyard
Where the desert wind
Will wash our skin
A lighter red

Let's make peace
Let's make war
Let's break into heaven for
A dance with heaven's devils or
Is that more than you can store
Inside your head

CHORUS

I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame
Slay my shame

Let's get gentle
Let's get pissed
Get your knickers in a twist
Cause the angel and the devil kiss
They fell in love

Some seem dirty
Some say clean
Something from a madman's dream
Am I really what I seem?
Rising to my head like cream
It feels so strange

Slay my shame
Slay my shame
I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame

Been around for quite a while
I see you kept it versatile
Motivated to combine
Even when it's bad it's fine

Did she say something that made you cry
Have you lost it all
The big fall
Oh, so slowly
Comes back holy

Bishop takes a knight
But I will put up quite a fight
Here's your ham on rye
Elementary the chemistry
Means everything to me
Long progression's why

Set it off to collect knowledge, quit a job and go to college
All about the aftershock
Swedish latin super funk

Moses of Manhattan made it great
Pain we celebrate
And I love

Elegant and integrated
Sweep your floors with pride

Smile
Cause it's all a ride
All supplied
And I love everything about
This session and this long progression


Yeah!


Bishop takes a knight
But I will put up quite a fight
Here's your ham on rye
Elementary the chemistry
Means everything to me
Long progression's why

In between the reason's are
The psychedelic seasons
Simple as your stride

Elementary the chemistry
Means everything to me
Long progression's why"
140,Look Around ,"Woo!
Stiff club, its my nature,
custom love is the nomenclature.
Turn down mass confusion,
hit the road 'cause we just keep cruisin'
Double my fun, double my vision,
long hard look at my last decision.
Hustle here, hustle there,
hustle me bitch and you best beware.

It's emotional and I told you so,
but you had to know so I told you.
Soft walk to horizon,
one big crash that no one dies in.
This for the folks in Fayetteville,
it'll come true if you say it will.

Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around

It's emotional and I told you so,
but you had to know so I told you.

Please don't look right though me,
hurts my heart when you do that to me.
Street life out my window,
City may breeze gonna stroke my skindow.
Just a lotta words on an old brick wall,
robbin' lotta banks gotta pedigree scrawl.
Put my peg into your square,
run around like we just don't care.

Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, oh yeah ah
Woo!

Move it ah gotta get ya, wanna get you / x2

Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, oh yeah ah

When I'm feeling small and I'm hitting a wall
Wanna feel it all around
When I'm feeling small and I'm hitting a wall
Wanna feel it all around"
141,Love Of Your Life ,"Sat on a cliff wondering what did I miss
I watched the waves come in,
Roll in, roll out, without a single doubt
Lone on the bluff, is there ever enough
I stare into the air, somewhere out there,
The family affair, bring home the night

There I know that you turn off the light
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life
She gave me the love, she gave the love

Coming up short and I’m sad to report, with us invite tonight
Your kiss, my kiss, another day to waste
Lovers don’t mix when they can’t even fix a plot that has a twist
To share, my ṗrayer, I need my baby bed,
Come home tonight
Whoa

There I know that you turned off the light
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life
There I know that you turned off the light
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life
Love of my life

There I know that you turned off the light
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life
There I know that you turned off the light
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life

There I know that I waited so long
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life
Oh she gave me the love of my life
Tell ‘em Flea, go ahead."

143,Love Trilogy ,"My love comes
and when it does
It's a crazy kind of 
selective affection
My love flows like a wise guy's tie
In the zaniest of directions
My love protection, 
my love erection
You better get some 
of my infection
My love can be a bigger than the Hoover Dam

My love can hide behind a grain of sand
My love for life is fueled by the love for my band
My love is mother and the silly mystic man
Some people think he's bad,
They say he doesn't laugh, and ask my dad!

My love is death to apartheid rules
My love is the deepest depth of ocean blues
My love is the Zulu groove
My love is coop-a-loop move
My love is lightning blues
My love is the pussy juice
My love can't be refused
My love is the skin on my flute
My love, my love

My love began from love
My love for an unknown grubby bum
My love for the baby suckin' on his thumb
My love for the best set of buns
My love for the feel of the drums
My love for a bunch of knuckleheads
My love for the sweet smell in bed
My love for the legs that I spread
My love for the fat natty dread
My love, my love

My love is my toes in the sand
My love is my dick in my hand
My love is my toes in the sand
My love is my dick in my hand!

Yeah-ohhh-ohhh-ohhh!!!"
144,Lovin' And Touchin' ,"Loving and touching and
Laughing and squeezing and
Walking and joking and
Smiling and teasing
Hugging and kissing and
Rubbing and srubbing and
Styling and slumming and
Rolling and cumming
I'll hold you a lifetime
I'll love you forever
I'll make you my wife and
I'll never forget you
I'll give you my smile
On the face of your child
I will give you my love
I will give you my love

Loving and touching and
Loving and touching and
Loving and touching and
Loving and touching and love"
145,Magic Johnson ,"L.A. Lakers fast break makers
kinds of the court shake and bake all takers
back to back is a bad ass fact a claim that remains in tact
m-a-g-i-c see you on the court
buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart
m-a-g-i-c magic of the buck
other teams pray for dreams
but he don't give a [fuck]
penetrating the lane like a bullet train
comes the magic blood a telepathic brain
knucklehead suckers better duck
when the buck comes through like a truck
scott stops pops and drops it in
on his way back gets a little skin
from the hand of a man named a. c. green
slam so hard break your t.v. screen

take it to the hole make your mamma talk
I hate to burst your bubble but triple double trouble
is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble
l. a. lakers fast break makers
kings of the court shake and bake all takers
back to back is a bad ass fact a claim that remains in tact
lakers are the team that I watch on the telly
cause they got more moves
that a bowl full of jelly
the buck stops here - pops - then cheers
a roar through the forum
that deafens my ears
the one and only know if his kind
sits in a throne
not for the records that he holds
but for being bald and bold

146,Magpies On Fire ,"Magpies on fire
Making love like little wolves
Out on the porch
Can lead to medicine
Oh well I’m game
For anything at all

Scare crow’s a liar
Spins a yarn and no one
Ever checked it out
To see if it was real
Sold you the moon
Now it’s time to fall

All along
It’s like a bird
Who’s trapped alone
Inside your cage, love

What more do you want
How much more can you take
I love my mistakes
I’ve been here before

All and all
It’s just the call
Of something wild
Beyond your room

There’s a changing
Of the major chord
Your minor threat
Will do…love

My gun misfired
Shot myself instead
I guess I always knew
I’d be the one to lose
That screen door slams
Time to make a move

A bird who’s born
To live at half your age, girl
A bird who’s
Never really had a say

Least of all
She’s like a bird
Who’s now been freed
From someone’s cage"
147,Make You Feel Better ,"She's the one she's the only one
She's got ripped back light
Gonna make me come
I say...when I smile I'm a really smile
I got dreams so wide like a country mile

I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
Cause that's what we do

Pick a star in the open sky
I see you see me
And that is why I

Hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel your fire
Jump up to meet

I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
Cause that's what we do

Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better and
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
Oh yeah

In a world that has run amok
I've got to set my sights
Just to get struck

I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched out mouth
And a pack of style

I say...she's the one she's the only one
Make me search myself
Until I'm alone...and

Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea of stars
Make a diagram...and

Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better and
Someone to spare
When love is the only end and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better
Oh yeah

So alive I arrive on dust
You can search my mind
For the red on rust...I said
Take me there and she really cares
Lights up for me gonna hear my prayers
I said

I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
Cause that's what we do

Something out there
Where love is your only friend and
We are the ones
That will make you feel better and

Like two sweet peas
in an even sweeter pod
that's my friend
and my friends's named Bob
like the devil knows hell
I know Bob well
well enough to tell you
'bout his 67 smells
well enough to tell you
he's a hell-a-swell fellow
well enough to tell you
that we know each other better
than we know our selves
like freaks of a feather
we rock together
I know Bob well
but I think he knows me better

Me and my, me and my, me and my,
me and my, me and my friends

He's as close to me
as a friend can be
I'll be standin' by my buddy
he'll be standin' by me
just another half of
the two headed freak
but I need him like
my heart needs to beat
at this point
in this friendly verse
I've got to sing a little something
that I haven't rehearsed
it's about my man
and his name is Hillel
for who my love
is woul brother sacred
take it hickleberry
slim boy take it

Me and my, me and my, me and my,
me and my, me and my friends

Jacky's eyes are closed
but he's right on course
because he's guided by
the invisible force
he drives a kooky green chrysler
bad as anybody's porsche
he's a working class drummer
he's as strong as a horse

149,Meet Me At The Corner ,"Please don't ask me who, who you think I am,
I could live without that, I'm just a modest man.
Meet me at the corner and oh, tell me what to do.

Cause I messed up on you, and had I known all that I do now,
I'm guessing we're through now,
Proceeding into the forest, I will lay around and wait,
And I'll wait for you.

Please don't ask me where, where you think I've been,
I've been a lot of places but this could be my win.
Meet me at the corner where I'll, tell me what to do.
Cause I messed up on you, and had I known all that I do now,
I'm guessing we're through now,
Proceeding into the forest, I will lay around and wait,
And I'll wait for you.

I feel so bad, I thought you'd wanna know,
I feel so bad, I thought you'd wanna know,
Something I wanna show, I thought you'd wanna know.

Please don't say you want to keep in touch,
I bare to see you on the corner, that I just can't bare.
Meet me at the corner and oh, tell me what to do.

Cause I messed up on you, and had I known all that I do now,
I'm guessing we're through now,
Proceeding into the forest, I will lay around and wait,
And I'll wait for you.

And I turn, I turn my head when I thought I saw a sign from the gods,
A sign from the gods that you were meant to be mine, and it's fine,
Taking it all for a ride til the day when it's gone,
I mystified my way, it all went wrong when it's gone,
I live and I learn and I lose and I win, but it's better whenever,
Whenever I'm here, thank you girl for everywhere that I've been."
150,Melancholy Mechanics ,"Persistent mystic faults my vision
it's like always this point of collision

it's raining in my cranium
my head feels like a stadium

3 pounds of gray
about to burst
inside my 3 pounds
universe

It's raining in my cranium
my head feels like a stadium

These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind

Symbols I've been given to express my goal
always come up short
you know they just don't get that low

It's raining in my cranium
my head feels like a stadium

These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind

Quick release chemicals strike
with incomprehensible precision
Bio - organic electronics targeting
microscopic destinations of devastation

Cleaner than light
meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000
billions of micro maniacs unknown to most
as the uncontrollable soldiers
of suffering succotash
instantaneous infiltration leaves me with
a case of bustation, frustration,
alone in the
constellation of alienation
detached from empty conversation
I wait
I wait
for the wave to break."
151,Mellowship Slinky In B Major ,"I've got a mellowship, I've got a fellowship
I've got a nonstop ""yo swan"" hello chip
Born to adore the big bad bison
Thunderstorm and a man like Tyson
Popcorn peanuts lookin' at big butts
No I can not keep my mouth shut
Rockin' to the beat of the fabulous forum
My Lakers I adore 'em
Blush my lady when I tell her
The I do indeed love to smell her
Sopping wet your pink umbrella
Do the dog with Isabella

I'm so in love yes with an artist
Imagination, he's the smartest
Robert Williams, stroke and splatter
I attest to your gray matter
Living kings how true it rings
These are just a few of my favorite things

Good God where's my sleigh
Good God playing for days
Good God any day now
Good God take me away
Good God purple haze
Good God the baddest of brains
Good God anyday now
Good God ridin' my sleigh now

Being that I'm the duke of my domain
My hat goes off to Mark Twain
Singing a song about what true men don't do
Killing another creature that's kind of blue
Writing about the world of the wild coyote
Good man Truman Copote
Talking about my throughts 'cuase they must grow
Cock my brain to shoot my load
I'm on the porch 'cause I lost my housekey
Pick up my book I read Bukowski
Can I get another kiss from you
Kiss me right here on my tattoo

(repeat 1st half of Good God section)

Good God DeNiro's insane
Good God rackin' my brain
Good God anyday now
Good God take me away now take me away

Me my friends and the sex machine
Do unto others like my brother Bean
I know you've got a mother
So give her a hug
I know you've got a mother
With a whole lot of love
Billy sings and Basie swings
These are just a few of my favorite things"
152,Mercy Mercy ,"Oh mercy, mercy, mercy me
I look around I need another remedy
The ""I don't know"" is philosophy
Better yet, I'll let you get ahead of me

Oh mercy, mercy , mercy me
Come around I need another enemy
Anyone could clearly see
A summer breeze is part of my anatomy

When it's written in Britain
We get a little smittin
Like a kitten, a cuddle is where I'm benefitin'
Any higher the fire would have to petrify her
Upon the wire the flyer is gonna satisfy her

My love is forever, my love it can feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this

Mercy, mercy, mercy me
Comin' down I gotta catch the gravity
Even though we disagree
Give a kiss 'cause life could be the death of me
Acrobatic the static is getting too dramatic
Comin' down with the system
We'll get it systematic
Fascilitatin' the maiden my love is circulating
Rejuvenating the fading but never dialating

My love is forever, my love it can feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this

Mercy, mercy, mercy me
Lovin' on the color of an Emily
Easy as a guarantee
Better yet, I'll show you what you wanna see

My love is forever, my love it can feel this
My breathless defender
step forward and steal this
We aim to forever, I want you to feel this
My gentle defender
Step forward and steal this"
153,Midnight ,"Things will never be the same
Still I'm awfully glad I came
Resonating in the share of things to come
Never waiting when I know there's only one

Messed it up but rest assured
No one ever thinks they're cured
Just a minute while I reinvent myself
Make it up and then I take it off the shelf

Over the lawns of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we going

Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story

The rising moon is on the shine
The blood of Scorpio's a nine
Like the fear that's in eyes of every doe
Say it now cause John and Jane would like to know

Is it safe inside your head
Songs to serenade the dead
All along I said I know no enemies
Mix it up until there are no pedigrees

Over the lawns of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we going

Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story

Over the lawns of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Into the shadows showing

Enter the rolling tide
Over the ocean so wide
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we going

Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story

Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story

Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story"

I want anything that I can have, but I don't need nothin' and I never have 
Each damn day my heart's set far, but I'll be okay, cuz I don't starve 
Kids from the street the losing their emotion so damn snobby so out of touch 
With two hungry people who die as they stare at the city at night, you know it gives to share 
So listen up, you millionaires, every woman, every man, help all you can 
All races unite, and I will now concern to the type of problem that helps us learn

Anyway, I'd like to say ""oh yeah""
C'mon Chad!

My boy, he like to tell me what I had
Yeah now, what dyou do with everything you've had?
I don't know, that ain't bad
Woo, no, that ain't bad"
161,My Cigarette ,"My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
One minute, please, while I sit back and reflect
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

Sip from this glass of hours
We pass like faulty towers
My sweetness, it's not weakness
Black holes wink but she devours

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

Greek to me, I don't speak Latin
Island calling, must be Staten
Net King Cole and Dick Van Pattern
New York Dolls all dressed in satin

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
Just one possession in the life that we get
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

Jumping Jimmy, the cat is in the chimney
Curtain call and I need some anonymity
Trip my balls, beat, lost on Wall Street
We all fall, that's my cross street

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

This business of forgiveness
Free your mind and we bare witness
Bring me windshield wiper fluid
Clean my slate so I'm not 
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

Charming Mister Deadpan Laughter
Walking towards the things we're after
Dancing David Lee toastmaster
Take some chances, that's my rapper

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
So many daydreams that I tend to forget
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

Jumping Jimmy, the cat is in the chimney
Curtain call and I need some anonymity
Smokey defect, time to reflect
My game and now we eject

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
One minute, please, while I sit back and reflect
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my cigarette

Don't know how happy that a person can get

162,My Friends ,"My friends are so depressed
I feel the question
Of your loneliness
Confide..., 'cause I'll be on your side
You know I will, you know I will

X Girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate
On the prison phone
They want... to give her 7 years
For being sad

(Chorus:)

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

My friends are so distressed
And standing on
The brink of emptiness
No words... I know of to express
This emptiness

(chorus)

Imagine me taught by tragedy
Release is peace
I heard a little girl
And what she said
Was something beautiful
To give... your love
No matter what
Is what she said

(chorus)"
163,My Lovely Man ,"I used to shout
Across the room to you
And you'd come dancin'
Like a fool
Shuffle step
You funky mother
Come to me
All warm as covers

Rest with me
My lovely brother
For you see
There is no other
Memory so sad and sweet
I'll see you soon
Save me a seat

Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
Yes I'm cryin'
Now and no one can
Ever fill the
The hole you left my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can

In my room
I'm all alone
Waiting for you
To get home
Listen to Roberta Flack
But I know you won't come back

Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can

Just in case
You never knew
I miss you, Slim
I love you too
See my heart
It's black and blue
When I die
I will find you

Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
Yes I'm cryin'
Now and no one can
Ever fill the
The hole you left my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can

Well I'm cryin'
My lovely man
Well I'm cryin'
My lovely man
I'll see you later
My lovely man
We have some good time
My lovely man"
164,Naked In The Rain ,"Standin' on the corner of civilization
There's a time there's a place for me
In a world where I can't be found
Cold and mean people give me the creeps

Going to the jungle where the elephant roams
Got to get away gonna make it my home 

Losing my taste for the human race
Social grace is a waste of time
It's absurd when I look around
So sublime that we blow my mind

Naked in the rain with a killer whale
I can taste the salt when I lick his tail
(Chorus:)

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it

I never met an animal that I didn't like
You can come to me I won't bite
Don't you know dog is man's best friend
There is some love that you can't fight

Naked in the rain with black tattoos
Runnin' through the woods laughin' at the blues

(repeat chorus)

Listen to the talking heart in my chest
With this gift good Lord I am blessed
There's a lump and it's in my throat
I'm in love with the wilderness

Naked in the river skinny dippin' my way
In the waterfall I just wanna play

(repeat chorus twice)"
165,Nerve Flip ,"Back at the London dairy
We drank it all too soon
We drank to dysentery
Numb to the pain, everybody rain

Got high on pink flamingos
Santo will take a charge
A list of long Domingos
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Come kiss that circuit breaker
An image to enlarge
Let's celebrate the quaker
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
It's just a nerve flip to switch when it's time 
for the grind
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
It's just a nerve flip to switch when it's time 
for the grind
Nerve flip

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

The pain of growing younger
Big balding of a tire
The blitz and all its hunger
Electrical fire, standing on a wire
Song 5 for Curtis Mayfield
This dancing's so alive
The onion never stays peeled
Everybody move, everybody glide

Stab me with colored pencils
Backseat and butterflies
A song for flesh utensils
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I've been adjudicated
The court of social flaws
Some other dude she dated
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
It's just a nerve flip to switch when it's time 
for the grind
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
It's just a nerve flip to switch when it's time 
for the grind

Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
Slow down the rivers of time in your mind
Nerve flip"
166,Never Gone Away ,"You've never gone away from my head 
you've never gone away from my heart 
(i tried to hide from you 
i tried to keep myself alone) 

all the letters i sent you 
you'll read again tonight 

i even thought i was wrong 
cause you didn't receive with love 
those letters i wrote to you 
when i still love you 

"
167,Never Is A Long Time ,"If I stall at all or
Hesitate
The world of always
Never seems to wait
A comedy that could be
So divine

A shadow born
To steal the light of day
You woke me up
And said “c’mon let’s play”
Well now I know
That never has….it’s way

You are you are
The star I say
From far from far
From far away
The laws that cause
It all to stay
By you by you
By you by you
For you I do

I thought I’d done it all
I thought I knew
But nothing ever looked
As good as you
Now every never
That I knew was fine
Never is a long time

And now I share
This feeling with my dad
Stolen goods aren’t always
Half that bad
The never that we’ll always

The faded piping on your press
Will always have its place I guess
By you by you
A common love
That we can bless
The pleasure of
My child’s mess
Golden books
And tenderness
Have rescued me
From emptiness"

169,No Chump Love Sucker ,"She's a witch, a brat
a bonafide bore
what's more - she snores
and that is a fact
cow eyes lie
yes it's time to resist

how did I ever
get into this
how could I ever
have kissed that bitch
so what if she's
got big tits

She's the kinda girl
who changes her mind really quick
she's the kinda girl who
won't just let things sit

she came like a cat
like a cat to cat nop
she came in my lap
with her womanly hips
when I first met her
I came unglued
I played the part of
a blueblooded fool
I'm through with your sewage
I'm through with your trash
I always knew that I'd
get the last laugh

She's the kinda girl
who changes her mind really quick
she's the kinda girl who
won't just let things sit

like two trains on one track
bound for a crash
two red white and blues we were
destined to clash
I can't fix the future
I can't change the past
like fly by night news
we were not meant to last
I'm through with your bluefish
I'm through with your gash
I'm through being screwed with by
you and your wack attack

Jump back for chump love
you won't be back for cover
but no no no no
I'm no chump love sucker
No chump love sucker

I thought that your love
was a matter of fact
but I lost my pride
when I realized that
the smack in my bag
and my baseball bat
was all you were after
you dirty rat
she's a bitch and a brat
and a living disaster
she thought she was fast, boys
but I was faster"

nobody weird like me

intercourse with a porpoise
is a dream for me
hell bent on inventing
a new species

bust my britches

i'm a freak of nature
walking totem pole
look and see I think you'll agree

riding down the path
on the back of a giraffe
me and the giraffe laughed
cause I passed some gas

bust my britches

walking totem pole
look and see I think you'll agree
nobody weird like me

enchanted as a rabbit
that my life is a dream

171,Not the One ,"[Verse 1]
I'm not the person that you thought I was
I'm not the one you thought you knew
I'd do most anything to make you think that I'm the one
I do it all to get to you

[Verse 2]
You see me as the perfect compliment
You think that I'm someone to choose
You see me in a way that makes me want to reinvent
A person I could turn into

[Chorus]
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I'll wanna come
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I'll wanna run
Blue strides are calling and I can't stop fallin'
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I'll wanna run

[Verse 2]
I don't look like myself in photographs
Long days of time have been unkind
I miss the you, the one that makes me want to redefine
I'm not the one you fell into
I'm not the one, the one for you

[Chorus]
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I'll wanna come
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I'll wanna run

In a masochistic hold
Why don't you let go
Shake it off Just to redirect my flow
Come on let's go

Sit up straight
I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way
Into the light, heavy, middle weight
We don't stop, rock around the clock
Motor mooting off
In front of every other road block

Come again and tell me
What you're going thru
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due

Memories of everything
Of lemon trees on mercury
Come to me with remedies
From five or six or seven seas
You always took me with a smile
When I was down
Memories of everything
That blew thru 

Looking up into
A reverse vertigo
What an undertow
Give it up
Another stubborn Scorpio
Come on let's go

Sit up straight
I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way
Into the light, heavy, middle weight
We don't stop, rock around the clock
Motor mooting off
In front of every other road block

Come again and tell me
What you're going thru
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due
v To the moon she gave
Another good review
Turn around and look at me
it's really really you

Memories of everything
Of lemon trees on mercury
Come to me with remedies
From five or six or seven seas
You always took me with a smile
When I was down
Memories of everything
That blew thru

Sit up straight
I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way

Lady bug. pine tree
To mingle with the bumblebee
A lover to the sun
And a brother to the cool breeze

Chorus

We live in the city,
We live in the jungle
It's time to be drinking
A thimble humble
Everything you ever see
Is never more than you and me
Give it on into the beauty of the mystery

One big mob, in one big home
A broken home
I'd like to share some air with you,
Some air with you
A morning forest full of truths
The green is blue
The head that's getting pregnant lives
to give and give

What was I thinking in my head
The color red
Breaking hearts instead of bread
Something I said
Checkmated by frustration
Need to be cut loose
A different kind of being lost,
A sullen cost

Scrawled upon the wall
Of a bathroom stall
A stranger wrote a note
That spoke to all
One two, buckle my shoe
Take care of me,

Riding on my bike
Me with my friend
We're so alike

Am I all alone

Have is this
We just had to stop
And share a kiss

Am I all alone

One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it 
If I chase it I might waste it, come and spin it

Am I all alone
Am I all alone 

Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon
And eat the sun
Sitting in the fire

Am I all alone 

Close your eyes
And click your heels
Can you believe
How good it feels

Am I all alone 

One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it 
If I chase it I might waste it, come and spit it

Am I all alone
Am I all alone 

Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon
And eat the sun
Sitting in the fire

Say goodbye to where you got it now
Pay your father, pay your twenty, take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your mamma, pay your father take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your father, pay your twenty, take a bow

Three pounds of love inside my skull
A million more lives it's never dull
Just a few times spun, spun around the sun
A couple more or less and then we're done

Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon
And eat the sun
Sitting in the fire"

Now they read those catalogs
This commerce makes me nauseous (Ah)

So I drive in search of smiles
XM on, let's check out Miles

This slice of life when you're out on the road

Anyway, I was headed south
Taste of coffee in my mouth
Up that off-ramp 405
Angry drivers on both sides
Got a call from my good friend Dave
He said, ""Yo, let's get that wave""
I said, ""Yes, just tell me where""
Board's up top, wind in my hair
From the mind of Frida Kahlo
Show me love and I will follow
From the words of my old man (Old man)
Conversations in the sand

Time and time again, life-changing rendezvous

[Zwrotka 3]
Anyway, made a left on third
Got distracted, jumped that curb
Unaware and on her walk
I hit the brakes, made time to talk
She said, ""Can I get that ride?""
Oh my God, just get inside
It was all that I imagined
Born to ride, enthusiasm
Packed our bags and headed west
PCH, I'm so impressed
My friends said, ""Havin' fun yet?""
We drove off into the sunset

177,Open/Close ,"So we were down in Brazil and, man, that place is wild.
We were in Rio de Janeiro, and uh, we had this, this sort of, uh,
security-guard type guy, and he was supposed to take us around and say hey,
could, you know, could you take us to the,
the favelas and show us the prostitution and the drug deals and the night fights and the,
you know, the street life of your town, and he said sure, so we, we pull up to this hooker,
and she's wearing some kind of a, a bright green miniskirt, and it turns out it's a transsexual,
and he says ""Get over here!"" and she comes over and she thinks she's busted, but she's not busted.
Naw, she's not busted, he just wanted to smack her on the ass a few times and say ""Hey, what's up, girl?""

Get out of bed and I clear up my head and I don't want to go but I do it instead
We are dreams within a dream 

Get into bed and I turn off my head,
and I started to float but I sunk when she said, ""we are dreams within a dream""

So I remember we got our driver's license, and my friend Hillel had this little Dodson, painted green, and...
Hollywood would get so crazy in the winter--the rains would come and the hills would just kind of melt down into the city lights,
and, well, you know, we smoked weed and we'd go up in the hills and we'd listen to progressive rock music and just kind of trip out and...
well, we would dream, you know, we would dream, and we would talk about what we wanted to do, and we would talk about girls and music,
and, you know, Hillel wanted to be a rock star--I didn't even know what that was, I was like, whatever you wanna do, man, I'm coming with you.
I'm right with you, my friend. 

Get out of bed and I clear up my head and I don't want to go but I do it instead
We are dreams within a dream 

Get into bed and I turn off my head,
and I started to float but I sunk when she said, ""we are dreams within a dream""

(La la la...)

Why in the world would you want it to be--why would you wanna take it so... so literally? 
All these things that come down from the sky, raining upon your head, make you stop and wonder why--ah! 
Can't they just spell it out, make it clear, make it easy to read for the simple man like me? 
I don't think so 
I reach out to my family and I say 
It's not about religion and the God sitting in a chair in the sky with a punishing hand, oh
It's about heaven in your heart 
Now when do we start? 
I wanna choose love instead of fear
Won't you come right now over here and be a part of my
We'll make it easier 
This time
I love you"

Will I slide? 
Well separate my side 
I don't 
I don't believe it's bad 
Slittin' my throat 
It's all I ever 

I heard your voice through a photograph 
I thought it up 
And brought up the past 
Once you know you can never go back 

I gotta take it on the otherside 

Well centuries are what it meant to me 
A cemetery where I marry the sea 
The stranger things that never change my mind 

I gotta take it on the otherside 
Take it on the otherside 
Take it on 
Take it on 

How long, how long 
Will I slide? 
A-separate my side 
I don't 
I don't believe it's bad 
A-slittin' my throat 
It's all I ever 

Pour my life into a paper cup 
The ashtray's full 
And I'm spillin' my guts 
She want to know 
Am I still a slut?

I gotta take it on the otherside 

A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed 
A candidate for my soul mate bled 
Mmm-push the trigger 
And I pull the thread 

I gotta to take it on the otherside 
Take it on the otherside 
Take it on 
Take it on 

How long, how long 
Will I slide? 
Separate my side 
I don't 
I don't believe it's bad 
A-slittin' my throat 
It's all I ever 

Turn me on
Take me for a hard ride 
Burn me out 
Leave me on the otherside 
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend 
I tear it down, I tear it down 
And then it's born again 

How long, how long 
Will I slide? 
Separate my side 
I don't 
I don't believe it's bad

180,Out In L.A. ,"We're all a bunch of brothers livin' in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called L.A.

L.A.'s the place, sets my mind ablaze
For me, it's a race through a cotton pickin' maze

The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks
Well sure, it's got some chumps but I still get my kicks
My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick
Like a come on a thumb
Poppin' hump, hump, hump, pop out

The action never stops, I'm as wild as can be
'Cos I'm shooting for the top and my best friend's Flea
Oom Chucka Willy knew that balls could pop
But he never met the Tree so he never be-bopped out hop!

Antoine the Swan, from the pretty fish pond
Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong
He wore a cold paisley jacket and a hellified ass
And between his legs was a cock suckin' lass

He threw a hundred women up against the wall
And he swore to fear that he'd fuck 'em all

By the time he got to ninety nine, he had to stop
Because that's when he thought that he heard a FOP!

Last night and the night before, I heard a
Fop outside, then I came in doors
Rock out!

Now that I told you a little something about the Flea
A little something about the Tree, a little something about me
I can't leave you hangin' but my man Sherm zee, he swings the yang, he bangs the 
yang
And now, it's time to hear him do his thang, you better be burning Sherman!

We're all a bunch of brothers livin' in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called L.A.

Step out!"
181,Out Of Range ,"Leaving town I found a flower that I could deserve 
Someone moves and someone's bound to get their feelings hurt 
I'm loving you, you're out of range 
Wanted you you're out of range 

As I walked out into a world I feel a sudden chill 
I was bleeding put it good onto a daffodil
Loving you, you're out of range 
Wanted to, you're out of range 

I don't want too much more than 
Than to be reborn 
In the morning 
Reborn so I can feel you 
The thorns of bougainvillea 
I feel you 

I have your number and I dialed it up a hundred times 
Barely there, your voice is crackin' up across state lines 
Loving you, you're out of range 
Wanted you, you're out of range 

Skies of ecstacy we're breaking well I do believe 
The tears of God were falling down upon my swollen cheeks 
Loving you, you're out of range 
Wanted to, you're out of range 

I don't want too much more than 
Than to be reborn 
In the morning 
Reborn so I can feel you 
The thorns of bougainvillea 
I feel you 

I know it hurts when it's taken away 
I tell you that I could be living 
Today with you or without you, ok 
Washed by the rain and it's all gonna change 

I don't want too much more than 
Than to be reborn 
In the morning 
Reborn so I can feel you 
The thorns of bougainvillea 
I feel you

No sir, not too much more than 
Than to be reborn 
In the morning 
Reborn so I can feel you 
The thorns of bougainvillea 
I feel you"
182,Outer Space ,"When I come to you, split this love in two
Overcome with fear but overdue
I set it free to let it move on

The crashing of your star, a fallen avatar
Goodbye wreckage now that we discard
Take it all so we can move on

Then I lost my grip, another sunken ship
Sinking into black and feeling sick
Now I know it's time to move on, on

I don't want to go, I don't want to go
I don't want to go to outer space
I don't want to know anything so cold
I don't want to go to outer space again

Easy come they say, hard as fuck to stay
Disconnected from my future day
The past is killing me so move on

And if it don't make sense, verbal violence
Sitting in your ship and on the fence
I get it's wrong to let it move on, on

I don't want to go, I don't want to go
I don't want to go to outer space
I don't want to know anything so cold
I don't want to go to outer space

I don't want to know when I lose control
I don't want to go to outer space again"
183,Over Funk ,"Press start dirty 
It’s 7:30 
Loss of might and 
Cat alertly 
My best, your rest 
Send your call 
And then I nest 

Perversity in features 
Adversity the teachers 
Some call love more 

Soon I’ll call the rhythm song 

It’s over 
It’s over now 
So long to doo-doo-ra 
It’s over 
It’s over now 
I dare not get a look 

Be yourself 
Some let her call 
Never fall 
See yourself 
Sit alone and wait 
To my own call 

Go ballistic 
Anarchistic 
Smack my mouth and 
Then you kissed it 
So long, my gun 
Simple run and 
Letter bum 

Things are looking good on paper 
Once when I was in your favour 
This kiss is a mess 
Send my girl riddle less 

It’s over 
It’s over now 
So long to riddle songs 
It’s over 
It’s over now 
I dare not read a song 

See yourself 
Sad, alone and wait 
To my own brawl 
Free yourself 
There’s an only count 
This stands for all of them 

Just play at any tempo 
Going mad and going mental 
All balm, said no 

Just to let him put it wrong 

It’s over 
It’s over now 
So nice to get along 
It’s over 
It’s over now 
It’s over 
It’s over now"

Just like me

California king
I swear it's everywhere

Staring straight up into the sky
Oh my my a solar system that fits 
In your eye microcosm

You could die but you never dead spider web
Take a look at the stars in
Your head fields of space kid

A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same
Bless your heart girl

Kill the pressure it's raining on
Salted cheeks 
When you hear the beloved that song
I am with you

Semi-naked flowers by my side

Oh, tell me, motherfucker, can you feel my vibes?
She's a lover to dance on Earth
Now I know the meaning of what it's worth

Shout out to my lonely friends, a message that I meant to send
I got peace and love for you right now
And when I see my little sis, a middle western genius
She's got peace and love for you somehow

Drift with me, Woodson, to another side
A streak of violence be lion's pride
Sober señorita and two hundred tears
A trail of happiness and tears have dried

Shout out to my lonely friends, a message that I meant to send
I got peace and love for you right now
And when I see my little sis, a middle western genius
She's got peace and love for you somehow

I've got peace and love for you right now
Surely as I jump this bus, nothing but the two of us
We've got peace and love for you somehow"

Shake it for me anyway

Got so much more
To offer the world
See what’s in store
Stay all day

Open the doors
And we never close shop
Stay all day

Take what you need to take
To forsake
Make it for me anyway
When we fill the void
That is Pink As Floyd
To destroy
Records that we file away
Now I’ll clean the slate
As I calculate
Your fate

Got so much more
To offer the world
See what’s in store
Stay all day
Someone to love
That’s my boy chip chop
Open the doors
And we never close shop
Stay all day
And you shine as you redefine
Your time, just another time of day
Do you feel the spark
When you play the part
Superstar
Fake it for me anyway
Time to tell them all
Without hem or haw
No applause
Tell them how to generate

How to raise the bar
How to keep it hard
Be alive, make it for me anyway
If you care at all
You will bare it all
You will grind
Shake it for me anyway
Born to play the part
Dying for your art
Cuz it’s time
Take it for me anyway
You will clear the air
With a single stare
Your fate"

189,Police Station ,"I saw you at the police station
And it breaks my heart to say.
Your eyes had wandered off
To something distant cold and grey.
I guess you didn't see it coming,
Someone's gotten used to slumming.
Dreaming of the golden years,
I see you had to change careers.
Far away, but we both know its somewhere.

I saw you on the back page 
Of some pre press yesterday.
The drip wood in your eyes 
Said nothing short of love for pain.
I know you from another picture,
Someone with the most conviction.
We used to read the funny papers,
Fool around and pull some capers.
Not today, send a message to her.
A message that I'm coming, coming to pursue her.

Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I've got ten times over
i'll chase you down
Till you're dead

I saw you on a TV station 
And it made me want to pray.
An empty shell of loveliness 
Now dusted with decay.
What happened to the funny paper?
Smiling was your money maker.
Someone ought to situate her,
Find a way to educate her.
All the way, time to come and find you.
You can't hide from me girl,  
So never mind what I do.

Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I've got ten times over
i'll chase you down
Till you're dead

I saw you in the churchyard
There was no time to exchange.
You were getting married 
And it felt so very strange.
I guess I didn't see it coming,
Now I guess it's me who's bumming.
Dreaming of the golden years,
You and I were mixing tears.
Not today, not for me but someone.
I never could get used to, 
so now I will refuse to.

Down home country 
I rest my face on your bed.
Meet my soul mate country
And I left it all for your head
I got my best foot forward 
And I'll chase you down till you're dead."

Can you bear not to share with your child

Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

Up to my ass in alligators
Lets get it on with the alligator haters
Did what you did did what you said
Whats the point yo whats the spread

I wish you were sober when you told me
That you were solid gold
Gravity-free is she, look at her
Hottest on the map she's full of anti-matter
You never look at very mellow impressions
Smell you with your going to hell expression

Are you laced up?
Well, are you really clean?

Can't refuse it
No matter who you are
Filling up your head with a bathtub rose
We composed it
But does it really show?
Slow your donkeys down

From a border town
I'm about to lose what little I've got
Please don't treat me
Like an afterthought

I'ma lose it if I do not find
Someone better reach out
Find a steady shine
Someone better reach out
Get it on the line
I'ma bruiser and I do not mind
Someone better reach out
Climb a mountain time
Someone better reach out
Get it on the line

Feel my call the lexicon makes its
Own way, own way
Break this fall, the excellence has it's
Own say, own say
Hazard pay for a canceled bear
Bygone Sally
With the greasy hair
Hard as nails but soft to wear
Rooftop crops up
And a folding chair
Pay your thug store Hench
Mugshot daddy
With the golden wrench
Locomotive smoke to cover up what's broke
Please don't seize me
Until you get my joke

I'ma lose it if I do not find
Someone better reach out
Find a steady shine
Someone better reach out

This may come as a shocking surprise 
I have to take a walk 
I have to kiss it goodbye 
Goodbye my love 
Goodbye my love 
I am not alive 

Walk away and taste the pain 
Come again some other day 
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid 

Walk away and taste the pain 
Come again some other day 
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid 
Funny how the price gets paid 
Funny how the price gets paid"
198,Red Hot Mama ,"A luscious bitch she is, true
But it's not nice to fool mother nature
The proud mother of god like all ho's
Is jealous of her own shadow
Who is this young Vic Tanny bitch
Who wish to be queen for a day?
Who would sacrifice the great grandsons and daughters of her jealous mother
By sucking their brain until their ability to think was amputated
By pimping their instincts
Until they were fat, horny and strung-out
In a neurotic attempt to be queen of the universe
Who is this bitch?

Red hot mama from Louisiana
Thumbin' her way to Savannah
She been cooped up too long

Red hot mama lookin' to the city
Taxi dancers and big time spenders
She's been groovin'

Red hot mama was gettin' down
Scoping the places where fun to be found
She was smokin'

Ride on, red hot mama
Girl, you sure look good to me
Ride on, red hot mama
Girl, you sure look good to me
Ride on, red hot mama
Girl, you sure look good to me
Ride on, red hot mama
Girl, you sure look good to me

Red hot mama was really bad
She was badder than bad, bad as she want to be

Red hot mama was a real gas
Doin' it good and doing it fast
She was smokin'

Whoa, {etc}!

Ride on red hot mama
Girl, you sure look good to me
Ride on red hot mama
Girl, you sure look good to me

199,Right on Time ,"One shot all I need 
I've got rhythm when I bleed

‘Til death do us part
Break my heart so I can start

Supercalifragilistic
Kiss me in the futuristic
Twisted but I must insist
It's time to get on top of this

It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time it's right on time it's right on time 
It's right on time
Lookin' fine you're lookin' fine get on 1999
It's right on time

Discard to bombard
Calling you all you shooting stars

Holy cow bow wow wow
Now I'm here I'm nowhere now

Joan of Arc reincarnated
baby we could be related
So much blood to circulate
And so much space to decorate

It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time it's right on time it's right on time 
It's right on time
Lookin' fine you're lookin' fine get on 1999
It's right on time

The plain and simple pain
I want to but I can't complain

Death row let us go
It's time to blow up for show

All the world reverberated
Coming through we motorcaded
Vibrate when we operated
Turing up in solid stated

Far away where no-one goes now 
Take my place in golden space 
Of TV stars that no-one knows now 
Deep deep mystery is talkin' to me 
Shes the giver of constant animation 
All around and ready to make a new formation

Your supernatural energy 
Part of my scenery 
What I belong to is you ecstacy

Your faith unwavering is king 

The clone of my own loneliness has got to fade 
What am I known to? 
Little garland in your starling 
Loving waves that I've succumbed to 

Deep deep mystery is talkin' to me 
She's the giver of constant adulation 
All around and ready to make a new formation 
You're the reason I'm in this world...

And let us check the surf

204,Roulette ,"The college years were lean, well
Coming out but maybe not so clean, my love
And if I stay much longer
My feelings for you, they might get much stronger now

A Motorola coma
Sleep your way into a deep diploma, girl
At the dormitory
You come to pour me one of your best stories, girl

And I feel your face getting wet
Like the color red of roulette
And I place my losing bet
On your side

And I see your eyes of regret
But you gave as good as you get
Like the Massachusetts threat
Running wild

A pair of dirty jeans, well
You would wash inside my brass machine, that's good
Laying on your mattress
A thing of beauty, we would need more practice now

Hall and Oates were singing
The funny notes that you were always bringing, girl
An elevator's closing
Hard to hide when love is so exposing

And I feel your face getting wet
Like the color red of roulette
And I place my losing bet
On your side

And I see your eyes of regret
But you gave as good as you get
Like the Massachusetts threat
Running wild

When I drove her
To Villanova
Light me up when you decide
The stark aroma
Of your Tacoma
A tiny box where we reside

Battle tested
A life invested
Duly noted and denied
Fully loaded
Space encoded
A quiet night out in the sky

Your stack of lies was daunting
A tribute to your mind, but way more haunting now
A talking psycho killer
Betrayed the heads of even Henry Miller now

Conspiracy's a theory
I wonder, Tim, if this could be your Leary, love
She acts like Marlon Brando
Born online inside the San Fernando"
205,Runaway ,"Walkin' around
Out of a town
Walkin' it out
When you want to
Soldiering my style is smiling
Turn it into whatever I've chosen
Take me now to the water

Don't be late I hear it's
Gonna be so very great and
Out the door I'm a walking like a runaway
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away
More and more I'm a walking like a runaway

Kick it around
Stare at the ground
Breakin' it down
When you want to
Soldiering my days I've chosen
Dancing round do whatever I want to
Take me now it's the water

Don't be late I hear it's
Gonna be so very great and
Out the door I'm a walking like a runaway
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away
More and more I'm a walking like a runaway

I think I know, everything you're gonna say
I think you know, don't want to runaway

Don't be late I hear it's
Gonna be so very great and
Out the door I'm a walking like a runaway

History's so strong
History's so strong
History's so strong

Sing another drinking song the honkytonk will do
Making another breaking bone your favorite ingenue
This the distant dawn
This the distant dawn

I put my cards upon the table
I do this because I am able
One picks his broken down devotion
I threw my pistol in the ocean
Eyes wide with revelation
Shine at the police station
And when the verdict comes round
I'm sure that you will go down

CHORUS:
Stay all night
we’ll save the population
Stay all night
we’ll save the population
Stay all night
we’ll save the population
Stay all night
we’ll save the population

Pistol and its pawn
Sell it to the lexicon
A pistol and its pawn
Blood and border lines be drawn

Take another bottle down the brothel and the shrew
Make another awful sound, a rather gothic brew
History's so strong
History's so strong

I put my cards upon the table
I do this because I am able
One picks his broken down devotion
I threw my pistol in the ocean
Eyes wide with revelation
Shine at the police station
And when the verdict comes round
I'm sure that you will go down

Stay all night we’ll save the population..."
207,Save This Lady ,"I got more love than anything else
But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my health
Struck by the notion that it just might be
A method to the madness that i cannot see

Something for the freedom of a roughed-up soul
Forty-two years young is a little bit old
Boy named Sue sing a Tennessee tune
Got buffalo love living on the moon

[chorus]
Save this lady for me [x4]

Call me Alabama i'm a Seminole prize
Got time square hair and a bedroom eyes
Keystone cops and the billy bob chops
Gonna scare my kids gonna share my crops

Vampire blood and a baseball glove
Justa a little bit of what the girl is made of
National crash into the big lampoon 
With a creature coming up from the black lagoon

[chorus]

Losing ground true sounds of liberty
The forest of the north might hold the key

Rocking to the rhythm of a ragtime band
Black flag wave on on my truck my man
Blasting for jones and the great unknowns
Got cheap cologne seventy-six trombones

Looking for the lady that won't be afraid
When heaven needs a hammer gotta get things made
I got more love than anything else
But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my health

Affecting almost everything

The more I have something to bring

Call out my name
Call and I came

Forgiving any behavior

Anyone can
Always my man

I would never betray you
Look at me who could raise you
Face in the sand
Safe in your hand
You were always my favorite
Always my man
All in a hand

We are the red hots
And we're loving up the love me nots
The flowers in your flower potsa
Are dancing on the table tops
And now I see you in a beautiful and different light

Somebody gotta save my soul 
Baby detonate for me 

Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology 
Ain't got time to make no apology 
Soul radiation in the dead of night 
Love in the middle of a fire fight 

Honey gotta strike me blind 
Somebody gotta save my soul 
Baby penetrate my mind

To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum kissum kissum

In the mind is one design
To make you feel fine

Our lust for notes will boil your blood

Causing what is known as a juicy wet flood
Gettin' it gettin' it gettin' it good

The guilt they try and give you
Puke it in the nearest bin

Missionary madness
Sweep up culture with a broom
Trashing ancient ways
Is par for course
It's fucking rude

To think that you're above
The laws of nature what a joke

Smoke on which to choke

I might be a monkey
When it comes to being holy
Fundamental hatred
Get down on your knees and

It looks like me like heaven
Sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me all right

Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so
bright
She looks to me
She looks to me all right

It's a long walk down those tracks
It's a dirty walk in
It's a dirty walk in black
Gonna learn aww way too much
Shootin' dope in the back
Of a Cadillac Jack

Slow down the road to my back 40
She needs somebody to hold

Down in the South seas
Give me your mouth please
Resuscitation
Is the way i find these
I give you major
You gave me minor
Don't fade away 
Like an ocean line
Now

Lost in the valley
Without my horses
No one can tell me
What my remorse is

God made this lady 
That stands before me
She needs somebody to hold

She shows the world up with a smile
And then she throws the fight
She looks to me she looks to me

Down on the bathroom floor 
She's searching for another light 
She looks to me she looks to me

Don't like the Rolling Stones
She took a short cut
To being fully grown

She's got that mood ring
A little sister rose
The smell of Springsteen
A pair of pantyhose

This talking picture show
Is leaking from a silhouette
She said my man you know
It's time to get your fingers wet
Your hustle's busted when
You can't afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you
You were screaming ""handle it""

Knock the world right off its feet
And straight onto its head
The book of love will
Long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play for all the 
Brightest minds and light will shed

I heard some P-Funk
Out on the road again
To get your head shrunk
Is what I recommend

It's in your bloodline
A perfect Frankenstein
Out on that lone pine
I'm gonna make you mine

It's understood you wrap
Your voodoo right around my neck
You've got some glitter on your
titty at the discotheque
I put my lovin' in your oven
Not a head to check
The last I heard from you 
You were screaming ""resurrect""

Knock the world right off its feet
And straight onto its head
The book of love will
Long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play for all the 
Brightest minds and light will shed


Knock the world right off its feet
And straight onto its head

Long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you

Just come with me for a while
A nautical mile

Flowers in bloom
I get 'em off of the moon
To make my baby go boom
I put my grease in your spoon
Flowers in bloom
And you're the colors of June
Some days

Here we come, we're not far away
And I'll tell you more when I come to stay
Shoot me a smile
And I will show you the love always
Here we come and we're very close
And I'll give you more with this micro dose
Shoot me a smile
And I will show you the love always

Out on the road
I've got some cases to load
Some other places to go
Some other faces to know
Out on the road
Where I will show you the love parade
A lateral move
With nothing better to prove
Just hanging out with the crew
I'll put the wop in your doo
A lateral move
With nothing better to prove some days
Give me a home
I cannot make it alone
I need to share what I own
I'll be the cream in your cone
Give me a home
And I will show you the love always

Here we come, we're not far away
And I'll tell you more when I come to stay
Shoot me a smile
And I will show you the love always
Here we come and we're very close
And I'll give you more with this micro dose
Shoot me a smile
And I will show you the love always

I don't ever wanna lose my head
Last name's Hot and my first name's Red
I don't ever wanna get so tight
Wearing it loose like a summer's night
Strappin' for cash, I'm eating bangers and mash
And I remember The Clash, and I remember The Clash
Strappin' for cash but I will make you feel safe always
Bring it around just like the fox and the hound
Because it's openly crowned, I'm on a merry-go-round
Bring it around and I will sleep with a smile always
I never began because I'm never to end
I'm gonna buck every trend, I'm gonna make you my friend
I never began, but I will give you a start always

Here we come, we're not far away
And I'll tell you more when I come to stay
Shoot me a smile
And I will show you the love always
Here we come and we're very close
And I'll give you more with this micro dose
Shoot me a smile
And I will show you the love always"
218,Show Me Your Soul ,"Verse 1
In a world that can be so insane
I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you
I wanna know more than your brain

Into my life you were injected
Not something that I expected
Now I smile from your affection
We have made a soul connection
Just for whom does your bell toll
Don't be cold show me your soul

Chorus
Sentimental Gentlemen are not afraid to show you when
I am you, you're my best friend
Show me your soul

Verse 2
In a world that can be so insane
I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you
I wanna know more than your brain

Yes, I find you so appealing
When you show me how you're feeling
You, my friend, need not be kneeling
Open up and start revealing
Trust in me my heart is sole
I need to see, show me your soul

Chorus

Verse 3
In a world that can be so insane
I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you
I wanna know more than your brain

Don't expect too much from me
Perfection is no test for me
Because the best I'll ever be
Is just like you: A human being
You won't offend, I need to know
Please, my friend, show me your soul

Chorus

219,Sick Love ,"Say goodbye to Oz and everything you own
California dreamin' is a Pettibon
LA's screaming you're my home
Vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there

I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

Stick n move you're living in a quick world
Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl
Born into it that's for sure

Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche

People talk and tell you what you want to hear
Do you really need another souvenir
Super heroes tend to disappear
Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
Chase your tail my baby it'll be your last

I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home

Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche

Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective
How your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche

Openly defective is the lover you elected and
A portrait she was bound to portray"
220,Sikamikanico ,"Everybody knows we're Hollywood skunks
Soulful sexy funky monks
My tinsel town is made of steel
Let's whip, let's shout, let's make a deal !

Hollywood and Hollywood not
We are so lively on the spot
Never sold out always in stock
Are you deaf or does this rock?!

Silly little creature, Sikamikanico
Sittin' on a bleacher, Sikamikanico
I don't want a teacher, Sikamikanico
If we're gonna reach ya, Sikamikanico
Don't you know 'bout Frank Sinatra
That's all gone because I got up
We don't just play, we display
Gotta give it up, gotta do it my way

Shootin' my sex into the cave
You mind receives my radio wave
Shake it girl, you won't get hurt
I knock my dick into the dirt

Silly little creature, Sikamikanico
Sittin' on a bleacher, Sikamikanico
I don't want a teacher, Sikamikanico

We doubt our mama's been confused
It's plain to see we rock the groove
If you don't like it, time to move

And all the press, you don't amaze me
I'm not your dick so don't appraise me
Never gonna fit your critical shit
You better watch out, you might get hit

Silly little creature, Sikamikanico
Sittin' on a bleacher, Sikamikanico

221,Silent Partners ,"We have to take our chances, we have to keep it down 
We have to steal our kisses when nobody's around 
We have to hide the tenderness inside 
To make love on the sly, you say it's for the better 

We have to speak in riddles to cloak the things we say 
We have to watch our whispers, not to give ourselves away 
We have to run in shadows in the dark 
We have to stand apart when they see us together 

So we're livin' like silent partners, sneakin' like thieves in the night 
Can't let it show, gotta keep it low, so no one knows 
We're silent partners, never come to the light 
It'll never be right, whatever we do 
You need me too much and I'm just not givin' up on you 

We have to keep the secret burnin' on our lips 
We'd both be hurting someone if they caught us here like this 
We have to bear this burden that we share 
Knowin' our affair just can't go on forever 

And we're livin' like silent partners, sneakin' like thieves in the night 
Can't let it show, gotta keep it low, so no one knows 
We're silent partners, never come to the light 
It'll never be right, whatever we do 
You need me too much and I'm just not givin' up on you 

Silent partners 
I can't let it show, we gotta keep it low, so no one knows 
We're silent partners, are we ever gonna come to the light? 
It'll never be right, whatever we do 
You need me too much and I'm just not givin' up 

Silent partners, sneakin' like thieves in the night 
Can't let it show, gotta keep it low, so no one knows 
We're silent partners, are we ever gonna come to the light? 
Can't let it show, gotta keep it low, so no one knows 
We're silent partners, sneakin' like thieves in the night 
Can't let ... [fade out]

222,Sir Psycho Sexy ,"A long, long, long, long time ago
Before the wind before the snow
Lived a man, lived a man I know
Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho

Sir Psycho sexy that is me
Sometimes I find I need to scream

He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go

Deep inside the Garden of Eden
Standing there with my hard on bleedin'
There's a devil in my dick and some demons in my semen
Good God no that would be treason
Believe me Eve she gave me the reason
Booty lookin' too good not to be squeezin
Creamy beaver hotter than a fever
I'm a givin' 'cause she's the receiver
I won't and I don't hang up untill I please her
Makin' her feel like an over archiever
I take it away for a minute just to tease her
Then I give it back a little bit deeper

Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea he's the man that I met one time
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea he's the man that left me blind
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea he's the man he's the man he's the man
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea yea

He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go

I got stopped by a lady cop in my automobile
She said get out and spread your legs
And then she tried to cop a feel
That cop she was all dressed in blue
Was she pretty? Boy I'm tellin' you
She stuck my butt with her big black stick
I said ""What's up?"" now suck my dick
Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb
She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand
On her crotch so very warm
I could feel her getting wet through her uniform
Proppin' her up on the black and white
Unzipped and slipped ""Ooo that's tight""
I swaited her like no swat team can
Turned a cherry pie right into jam

Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea I'm the man that you met one time
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea I'm the man that leaves you blind
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea I'm the man I'm the man I'm the man
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea yea

Hello young woman that I love
Pretty punk rock mamma that I'm thinking of
Hold me naked if you will
In your arms in your legs in your pussy I'd kill
To be with you, to kiss with you, I do miss you
I love you

Lay me down lay me down lay me down lay me down
Lay me down lay me down lay me down lay me down

Descending waves of graceful pleasure
For your love there is no measure
Her curves they bend with subtle splendor

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the funk will make me freak
If I should die before I waked
Allow me Lord to rock out naked
Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip
Calling up a little girl with a bull whip
Lickety split go snap ""snap""
Girl gettin' off all in my lap
The tallest tree, the sweetest sap
Blowin' my ass right of the map
Ooow and it's nice out here
I think I'll stay for a while"
223,Skinny Sweaty Man ,"Flashin' lots of cash and spendin' lots-o-loot
he's sitting at the bar - then he's sittin' at the booth
across the dance floor he does scoot
he's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

The caboose that could he goes toot toot
been known to gag and sometimes puke
a very good friend of granny goose
he's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

Skinny sweaty man in the green suit

He's half man and half cartoon
but good buddy don't be confused
he's full blooded looney tune
he's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

Face to face with the man in the moon
his family doctor is doctor seuss
if you catch him in your soup please don't shoot
he's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

Skinny sweaty man in the green suit

He was new in town
a free wheelin' clown
a funny young duke
hangin' under the roof
of a place in time
united sound

he'll play a little guitar sing a few blues
he's the kind-a-guy that you can't refuse
despite the fact that he's no brute
he's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit

Strike the magic groove make him jerk and move
like an eight legged freak in snake skin boots
coming soon to a theatre near you
he's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit"
224,Slow Cheetah ,"Waking up dead, inside of my head
Would never, never do, there is no med
No medicine to take
I’ve had a chance to be insane
Asylum from the falling rain 
I’ve had a chance to break

It’s so bad, it’s got to be good
Mysterious girl misunderstood
Dressed like a wedding cake
Any other day and I might play 
A funeral march for Bonnie Brae
Why try and run away?

Slow cheetah come before my forest,
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come, it's so euphoric,
No matter what they say

I know a girl, she worked in a store
She knew not what her life was for
She barely knew her name
They tried to tell her she would never be 
As happy as a girl in a magazine
She bought it with her pay

Slow cheetah come before my forest,
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come, it's so euphoric,
No matter what they say

Everyone has so much to say
They talk, talk, talk their lives away
Don’t even hesitate
Walking on down to the burial ground
It’s a very old dance with a merry old sound
Looks like it's on today

Slow cheetah come before my forest,
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come, it's so euphoric,
No matter what they say

Slow cheetah come before my forest,
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come, it's so euphoric,
No matter what they say"

Were in my life just to get high on

And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on
Come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey oh listen what I say oh

Hey oh now listen what I say oh

When will I know that I really can't go
To the well ones more time to decide on
When it's killing me
When will I really see
All that I need to look inside
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me
What do I really need
All that I need to look inside

Hey oh listen what I say oh
Come back in
Hey oh look in what I say oh

The more I see the less I know
The more I like to let it go...hey oh

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through a field where all my tracks will
Be concealed and there is nowhere to go

When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up
I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on
Come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey oh listen what I say oh
I got your
Hey oh listen what I say oh

The more I see the less I know
The more I like to let it go...hey oh

Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through a field where all my tracks will
Be concealed and there is nowhere to go

I said, ""hey, oh yeah, oh yeah""
Tell my Lord now
Hey oh yeah, oh yeah
Tell my Lord now 

Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through a field where all my tracks will
Be concealed and there is nowhere to go

For the future memory lane

When I saw you
I hope I get what you deserve 
And this is where I find

Smoke surrounds your perfect face
And I'm falling
Pushing a broom out into a space
And this where I find a way

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing

Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon 
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushin' myself
And no I don't mind asking
Now 

Alone inside my forest room
And it's storming
I never thought I'd be in bloom
But this is where I start

Derelict days and the stereo plays 
For the all night crowd
That it cannot phase
And I'm calling

Tedious weeds that the media breeds
But the animal gets what the animal needs
And I'm sorry

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing

Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon 
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushin' myself
And no I don't mind asking
Now

And this is where I find

Rays of dust that wrap around
Your citizen
Kind enough to disavow
And this is where I stand

The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming

Stranded
Stranded
Stranded on a toilet bowl
What do you do when you're stranded
And there ain't nothing on the roll?
To prove you're a man
You must wipe it with your hand
Stranded
Stranded on a toilet bowl !"
234,Strange Man ,"All of my love and most of my fears
Been coming on strong for most of my years
Add up and end up in a song

 Cellophane tweeds and revenue streams
 Are blocking my shots and killing my dreams
 That showed how me to be the cause

 Ooh ahh yella, ooh ahh hey ah what now

 It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's right
 It's a long time for me, I see
 She wants to belong and i want to be free
 Ex-communicated cause there ain't no guarantee

 Ooh ahh yella, ooh ahh yeah

 All of my friends and enemies
 They were part of this dance that
 Put me right here we go
 So glad i got this chance

 Better known plans and lesser known schemes
 Were all about love and less about me
 I'd have to say she wore the pants

 That's oh

 It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's right
 It's a long time for me, uh huh
 She wants to belong and I want to be free
 Ex-communicated cause there ain't no guarantee

 Woo yeah
 Ahh
 I go
 Ahh
 I've been left


It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's right
It's a long time for me, lets see
She wants to belong here, i want to be free
Ex-communicated cause there ain't no guarantee

 It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's me
 It's along time for me, uh uhh
 She wants to be rich and i want to be free
 Keep yourplans elastic cause there ain't no guarantee"

receive it and believe it
and its moaning and creating love

tender titilations

i'll stretch you out

i'll stretch you out my friend

that way it is never wrong

236,Strip My Mind ,"Oh yeah 
Oh ohh yeah
Arthur J. did indicate it
The boulevard would never be 
So full of love and life again - yeah
(I'm sick of all your)

Hot as Hades early eighties 
Sing another song and make me 
Feel like I'm in love again - yeah
(how i lose the way i am)

Oh yeah 
Oh 
Please don't strip my mind 
Leave something behind 
Please don't strip my mind 

Oh yeah 
Oh ohh yeah
All in favor sign the waiver

Blow another top and sing - yeah

237,Subterranean Homesick Blues ,"Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement thinking about the goverment
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off,
Says he's got a bad cough: wants to get it paid off. 
Pay him off

God knows when but you're doin' it again!
You better duck down the alleyway lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap in the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills: you only got ten
So look out, kid

Look out, kid, because it's something that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid, lookout

Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' at the heat put plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway, maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A.
The double D.A

Walk on your tip toes, don't try ""no doz""
You better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, and an eye on the plain clothes
‘Cause you don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows
Look out, kid

Look out, kid, because it's something that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid

Looks to me like you did
A little to much hittin' kid
You should've took it to the bridge
Before you started to skid
Look out, kid

The good god willin', we'll bebop to Bob Dylan
Chillin'em, thrillin'em, and red hot killin'em
Killin'em, I said killin' em

Come on, come on

Get sick, get well, hand around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred, jump back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail


But users, cheaters, six time losers
Hang around the theatres
Girl by the whirlpool lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters
Look out, kid

Look out, kid, because it's something that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid
Look out, kid, because it’s something that you did, kid
Look out, kid, because they keep it all hid, lookout"
238,Subway To Venus ,"Step right up and listen please
You're gonna get it with the greatest of ease
Everybody gather round all aboard the underground
You've got to get in before you get out
And gettin' out is what it's gonna be about 
If you find that you are blind
Open your bashful mind
Let my band step inside
And take you on a cosmic ride
With honest sounds i'll paint your brain
For in this song i do proclaim
That once aboard this moving train
I'll do my best to ease your pain
Slinky as my speech may be 
On this trip you'll ride for free
This axis bold as love you see comes and goes so easily

Chours: Space is king or so i sing, subway to venus x2

Once aboard and feeling smooth
Like a liquid you will ooze
iInto a state of mind that soothes
Aw be my quest inside my grove
'Cause what i've got to give to you
Is gonna make you wiggle like a wiggley worm
'Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm
Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll

Chours: Space is king or so i sing, subway to venus x2

Take your body shake it around
Do the dog on the ground
And if i can't make you dance
I guess i'll just have to make you piss your pants

Chours: Space is king or so i sing, subway to venus x4"
239,Suck My Kiss ,"Yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, oh yeah
Hit me

Should have been, could have been
Would have been dead
If I didn't get a message
Goin' thru' my head
I am what I am
Most motherfuckers
Don't give a damn
Aw baby think you can
Be my girl, I'll be your man

Someone full of fun
Do me 'till I'm well done
Little Bo peep
Cumin' from my stun gun

Most motherfuckers
Have a cold ass stare
Aw baby please be there
Suck my kiss cut me my share

Hit me you can't hurt me
Suck my kiss

Give to me sweet sacred bliss
Your mouth was made to suck my kiss

Look at me can't you see
All I really want to be
Is free from a world

Do you want me girl
To be your thief
Aw baby just for you
I'd steal anything that you want me to

K - I - S - S - I - N - G
Chicka chicka dee

Low brow is how
Swimming in the sound
Of bow wow wow

Do me here I do allow

Hit me you can't hurt me
Suck my kiss
Kiss me please pervert me
Stick with this
Is she gonna curtsy?
Give to me sweet sacred bliss

Goin' thru my head
I am what I am
Most motherfuckers
Don't give a damn
Aw baby think you can
Be my girl, I'll be your man

Someone full of fun
Do me 'till I'm well done
Little Bo peep
Cummin' from my stun gun

Aw baby please be there
Suck my kiss cut me my share

Hit me you can't hurt me
Suck my kiss
