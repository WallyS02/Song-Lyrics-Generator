0,,"I saw you dancin'
You moved like Sinatra
On speed

The lights were a flashin'
And tongues were a waggin'
Over you
It's too late for trying
It's too late for denying
All those little things you and me have done
I'm sorry hun' 
I was hoping for a recall
Mix of you high from the sun
Ah but nothing
Only lone magpies come

I saw you dancin'
You moved like Sinatra
On speed"
1,2013 ,"Well the times are so a changin'
Baby even when it’s live
You can press pause and rewind
You knew it had to go amazing
But is this what you had in mind?
Oh there’s nothing you can’t find

It’s two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It’s two thousand and thirteen
(Yeah)

On the back of her transmitter
There’s a little shiny fruit
And it’s coming after you
As for Instagram and Twitter
She got caught in both lassoes
And neither one will cut her loose

It’s two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It’s two thousand and thirteen
(Yeah)
Yeah

So baby take a walk with me
Past flying cars and time machines
There’s magic like you won’t believe, no

It’s two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It’s two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy"
2,505 ,"I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that my darling
What did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

I’m not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite though its no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I'm going back to 505
If it's a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs and a smile"
3,7 ,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Well I wrote my number down
I never wrote it down before
Was gonna bring it over like something from a film
But I didn't have the bottle at all

Well I were looking and you kept staring
Your thoughts pairing up with mine
And when you're so pretty and I'm so shy
You probably didn't give me the eye though I'm sure you did

Well I went outside
Couldn't say I tried
And I felt regret
Because you haven't bashed me and dashed back in
Cause the ship hasn't sailed yet

But when I did I couldn't see your face
I could see your mates but that wouldn't do
Well I dashed around, tried to find you
But you were, nowhere to be seen
Oh no no...

(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)
(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)
(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)
(la la la, la la la, la, la la la la)

Well she moved in ways, that kept her there
In our minds for days
And weeks and months
I was that amazed
And there she stayed
Surrounded by the what if's and the maybe's"
4,A Certain Romance ,"Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse
Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there ain't no romance around there
And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see 'em, then you would agree
Agree that there ain't no romance around there

You know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell 'em if you like
We'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

'Cause over there there's broken bones
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here

Don't get me wrong, though there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just cause he's had a couple of cans
He thinks it's alright to act like a dickhead

Don't you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell 'em if you like
We'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

But I said
No! Oh no!
Well you won't get me to go
Not anywhere, not anywhere
No I won't go
Oh no no!

Well over there there's friends of mine
What can I say, I've known 'em for a long long time
And they might overstep the line
But you just cannot get angry in the same way
No, not in the same way
So not in the same way
Oh no, oh no no"
5,All My Loving ,"Close your eyes and I'll kiss you,
Tomorrow I'll miss you;
Remember I'll always be true.
And then while I'm away,
I'll write home every day,
And I'll send all my loving to you.

I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true.
And then while I'm away,
I'll write home every day,
And I'll send all my loving to you.

All my loving I will send to you.
All my loving, darling I'll be true.

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you,
Tomorrow I'll miss you;
Remember I'll always be true.
And then while I'm away,
I'll write home every day,
And I'll send all my loving to you.

All my loving I will send to you.
All my loving, darling I'll be true.
All my loving, all my loving,
Ooh, all my loving I'll send to you."
6,All My Own Stunts ,"Caricatures of your wrecking ball 
Gown in my mind all the time
I wanna be in that damsel-patterned alley
Where you go for a smoke

And sorrow slow dances
The phones are lighting up 
Taking no chances
Close but never close enough

Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

All my own stunts
High noon has changed its tune 
Linking arms, sinking hearts

And sorrow slow dances
Around the edges of her eyes
Taking no chances
The last one out to win a prize

Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

'Cause I'm from High Green, I'm from High Green"
7,American Sports ,"So when you gaze at planet earth from outer space
Does it wipe that stupid look off of your face?
I saw this aura over the battleground states
I lost the money, lost the keys
But I'm still handcuffed to the briefcase

And I never thought, not in a million year
That I'd meet so many lovers
Can I please have my money back?
My virtual reality mask is stuck on 'Parliament Brawl'
Emergency battery pack just in time for my weekly chat with God on videocall

Breaking news they take the truth and make it fluid
The trainer's explanation was accepted by the steward*
A montage of the latest ancient ruins
Soundtracked by a chorus of ""you don't know what you're doing""

And I never thought, not in a million year
That I'd meet so many lovers

And all of my most muscular regrets explode
behind my eyes like American sports

And I never thought, not in a million year
That I'd meet so many lovers

8,Anyways ,"Just another microcosm somewhere in the ether,
Putting the world to rights with Bing Crosby eyes

Oversharing and its bitter aftertaste
Exactly the wrong time,
in exactly the wrong place
Save it for a rainy day
Baby, you go hard in the paint
It’s just another race to Anyways

Philanthropic toga party
What a place for both the opposite sides
of my double life to finally collide

Sharing secrets I was taking to the grave
Nosebleeds from epiphanies I took full in the face
Oh, come o’er by the fire babe, let’s all participate
in yet another race to Anyways

Oh, how’s your mum and dad been doing with the generation gap?

Yeah!

I’m behind my movie camera
I’ve got my megaphone
You can call me Alexander
It’s nice to meet you all

Listening to the shipping forecast driving to the airport
Me and the guys
Metropolis ablaze in the rearview

Devising methods to both have and eat your cake
Mm, just like the ones that Mother Nature used to bake
You look as if you know exactly what I’m gonna say
Is just another race to

Anyways"
9,Arabella ,"Arabella's got some interstellargator skin boots
And a helter skelter around her little finger and I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality
She takes a dip in my daydreams

My days end best when this sunset gets itself behind 
That little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella, oh
As Arabella

Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

Arabella's got a 70s head
But she's a modern lover 
It's an exploration, she's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And a kiss the color of constellation falling into place

My days end best when this sunset gets itself behind 
That little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella, oh
As Arabella

Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

(That's magic) In a cheeath print coat
(Just a slip) Underneath it I hope 
(Asking if) I can have one of those
(Organic) Cigarettes that she smoke
(Wraps her lips) 'Round that Mexican Coke
(Makes you wish) That you were the bottle
(Takes a sip) Of your soul, and it sounds like

Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure"
10,Baby I'm Yours (cover Barbary Lewis) ,"Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until the stars fall from the sky,
Yours (yours) until the rivers all run dry
In other words, until I die

Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until the sun no longer shines,
Yours (yours) until the poets run out of rhyme
In other words, until the end of time

I'm gonna stay right here by your side,
Do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothin' in the world can drive me away
'Cause every day, you'll hear me say

Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until two and two is three,
Yours (yours) until the mountains crumble to the sea
In other words, until eternity

Baby, I'm yours
'Til the stars fall from the sky
Baby, I'm yours
'Til the rivers all run dry
Baby, I'm yours
'Til the poets run out of rhyme"
11,Bad Woman ,"When you left the house this evening,
You said you'd be back in a little while
Well I've been waiting for such a long time,
And this wait is driving me wild...

And while I wait I think about you,
Do you need me when I'm not there ?
Are you planning to be without me ?
Do you have a new attract ?

You're a bad bad woman
You're a bad bad woman

If he is on you...
It keeps flashing through my mind,
If you would only call,
If you would be so kind.
Imagine things,
I see another man
And it's this waiting I just can't stand...

You're a bad bad woman
You're a bad bad woman
You're a bad bad woman
You're a bad bad woman"
12,Balaclava ,"Running off over next doors garden
Before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling
Than it is a question of fun
The confidence is the balaclava
I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
Will the ending reek of salty cheeks
And runny makeup alone

Or will blood run down the face
Of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish
And you wish you'd never been born
And you tie yourself to the tracks
And there isn't no going back
And it's wrong wrong wrong
But we'll do it anyway cause we love a bit of trouble

Are you pulling her from a burning building
Or throwing her to the sharks
Can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start
The confidence is the balaclava, i'm sure you baffle 'em straight
And its wrong wrong wrong, she can hardly wait

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this....
Crime!

That's right, he wont let her out his sight
That's right, he wont let her out his sight
That's right, he wont let her out his sight

Will you be able to boast that the day held the most 
Flawless heist of all time

You knew that it'd be trouble right before the very first kiss
Quiet and assuming but you heard that they were the naughtiest
She pleaded with you to take it off
But you resisted and fought
Sorry sweetheart, I'd much rather keep on the balaclava"
13,Batphone ,"I want an interesting synonym to describe this thing 
That you say we're all grandfathered in
I'll use the search engine
(We've got much to discuss)
Too much to discuss over a bucket of balls
I can recall the glow of your low beams

It's the big night in Tinsel City
Life became a spectator sport
I launch my fragrance called 'Integrity'
I sell the fact that I can't be bought
Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole through a handheld device?
I will flashback now and again but I'm usually alright
Thankfully the process has been simplified since the last time you tried

I've recognized the glow of your low beams numerous times
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold 
Making a selection opening credits roll
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul

You go in through the door
Vengeance trilogy wallpaper walls
The have re-decorated it all
They've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side

I've recognized the glow of your low beams numerous times
Through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
The vehicles will pass by but I know when it's you
I'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
Right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold 
Making a selection opening credits roll
Killed pink flamingos, computer controlled
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul"
14,Big Ideas ,"That's quite a number to sing
Spot lit getting lowered in
Can you co-direct and play the twins?
And adapt the main theme for mandolins?
I've conjured up wonderful things
The Ballad of What Could Have Been
Over and out
It's been a thrill

I had big ideas, the band was so excited
The kind you'd rather not share over the phone
But now the orchestra's got us all surrounded
And I cannot for the life of me remember how they go

Co-ordinated release
Nationwide festivities
We had 'em out of their seats
Waving their arms and stomping their feet
Some just hysterical scenes
The Ballad of What Could Have Been
Over and out
Really it's been a thrill

I had big ideas, the band was so excited
The kind you'd rather not share over the phone
But now the orchestra's got us all surrounded
And I cannot for the life of me remember how they go
I just can't for the life of me remember how they go"
15,Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts ,"There’s always somebody taller
With more of a wit
And he’s equipped to enthrall her
And her friends think he’s fit
And you just can’t measure up
Though you don’t have a prayer
Wishing that you’d made the most
Of her when she was there

They’ve got engaged
Is no intention of a wedding
He’s pinched ya bird and
And he’d probably kick your head in

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you’re better off without her anyway
You said you wasn’t sad to see her go
Yeah, but I know you were, though

Now you don’t know what she’s up to you can only assume
If she’s not on the front of the shops
And then they’ve gone to his room
Bet she’s gone round in her school stuff
Bet that’s what he likes
I know you thought she was different
And you thought she was nice

But she’s not nice
She’s pretty fucking far from nice
She’s looking at you funny rarely
Looking at you twice

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you’re better off without her anyway
You said you wasn’t sad to see her go
Yeah, but it’s clear you were, though

Have you heard what she has been doing?
Never did it for me
He picks her up at the school gates
At twenty past three
She’s been with all of the boys
But never went very far
And she wagged English and science
Just to go in his car

They’ve got engaged
Is no intention of a wedding
He’s pinched me bird
And he’d probably kick my head in

Oh, now the girls have grown
Yeah, but I’m sure that they still carry
On in similar ways

Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, I’m better off without her anyway
I said I wasn’t sad to see her go
Yeah, but I’m only pretending, you know
Yeah, I’m only pretending, you know
I was only pretending, you know
I was only pretending, you know"
16,Black Treacle ,"Lately I've been seeing things
Belly button piercings
In the sky, at night
When we're side by side
And I don't mean to rain
On anybody's cabriolet
One of those games
You're gonna lose
But you wanna play it 
Just in case

Now it's getting dark
And the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars 
You're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

Does it help you stay up late
Does it help you concentrate
Does it tune you in
When you chew your chin
Am I ruining your fun

And you talk the talk alright
But do you walk the walk
Or catch the train
You wanted it, you got it
But you don't want it now

Now it's getting dark
And the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars 
You're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

Now I'm out of place
And I'm not getting any wiser
I feel like the Sundance Kid
Behind a synthesizer
And I tried last night
To pack away the laugh
Like a key under the mat
But it never seems to be there
When you want it

Black treacle
Black treacle
Black treacle"
17,Body Paint ,"[Verse 1]
For a master of deception and subterfuge
You've made yourself quite the bed, to lie in
Do your time traveling through the tanning booth
So you don't let the sun catch you crying

[Chorus]
So predictable, I know what you're thinking

[Verse 2]
My teeth are beating and my knees are weak
It's as if there's something up with the wiring
You can poke your head behind the mountain peak
It don't have to mean that you've gone into hiding

[Chorus]
So predictable I know what you're thinking

[Bridge]
I'm watching your every move I feel the tears are coming on
It won't be long
It won't be long

[Refrain]
Straight from the cover shoot
There's still a trace of body paint
On your legs and on your arms and on your face
And I'm keeping on my costume
And calling it a writing tool
And if you're thinking of me
I'm probably thinking of you

[Refrain]
There's still a trace of body paint
On your legs and on your arms and on your face
There's still a trace of body paint
On your legs and on your arms and on your face
There's still a trace of body paint
On your legs and on your arms and on your face
There's still a trace of body paint
On your legs and on your arms and on your face
So predictable I know what you're thinking
Ooh, hah, yeah"
18,Brianstorm ,"Brian
Top marks for not trying
So kind of you to bless us
With your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted

And I wonder
Are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes
Off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator

Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
'Cause you're smooth, and you're wet
And she's not aware yet
But she's yours

She'll be saying, ""Use me,
Show me the jacuzzi""
I imagine that it's there on a plate
Your whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened
To make them wait for a while
I doubt it's your style
Not to get what you set out to acquire 
The eyes are on fire
You are the unforecasted storm

(Brian) Calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not trying)
You leave the other stories standing
With your renditions and jokes
Bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their
Thunder 

Are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes
Off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator"

20,Catapult ,"Both sides
In softly came the growl from both sides
And if his whisper splits the mist
Just think of what he's capable of with his kiss

Nice try,
You cannot turn away, but nice try
He'll turn your legs to little building blocks and with his index finger flicks you on your socks

I go high pitched
He'll talk and make you voice sound high pitched
Dread to think if he got you on your own and whispered in your ear in that baritone

It's the same stone
His heart was cut out of the same stone that they used to carve his jaw
It's impossible not to feel inferior

And he could catapult you back to your daddy or into any hissing misery
And he will tell you how the day after a triumph is as hollow as the day after a tragedy
He'll extinguish any chance of escape when he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape
And he's leaving without saying 'bye'

And they would queue up to listen to him pissing and hang around to watch some poor girl blub
And then they'd chase him down the avenue incessantly pestering him to let him join the club
He knows how to put a cork in the fuss and just how to shut up the charming ones of us

And I've seen him talking to your lady friend

There's a dust track waiting for betrayal where he'll teach you all the bits they missed

Nice try, you cannot turn away, but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away, but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away, but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away, but nice try

You cannot turn away"
21,Choo Choo ,"My baby wants to drive the train

I said my baby wants to drive the train
Well all aboard yeah, and don't forget to mind the gap
Don't you let her, don't you know
She's sick and tired of
Being in the background, the passenger
Let her drive the train, oh!

Choo Choo!
Why don't you let her drive the train?
Choo Choo!
Why don't you let her drive the train, yeah

She's setting off from platform four
Make your way down, we'll shut the door bout quarter to five
I said she's setting off from platform four

With your short sharp tips
No, I won't read your lips right now
And baby, hey
You send a shiver down my spine
But do you read my mind
Do you...
And you're looking pretty suspicious
And probably planning a heist
He's wanting to go to the strippers
It makes him feel all nice

The cigarette smoke in your eyes
Watching a stripper and

Smacking a bloke here tonight

Get out the way, mister
With your short sharp tips
No, I won't read your lips right now
And baby, hey
You send a shiver down my spine
But do you read my mind
Do you...

He's prob'ly got stopped by a panda
For speeding on his way there
A formal flashing of digital cameras
From tourists in trafalgar square

(Cigarette smoke yeah)
The cigarette smoke in your eyes
Watching a stripper and
(Snortin' some coke yeah)
Snortin' some coke off her thighs
Bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla...

The cigarette smoke in your eyes
Watching a stripper and

23,Cigarette Smoker Fiona ,"Sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses
 With wet white trousers on
 And worlds collide as the evening continues
 The dignity fucks off

 Her brother's gone off to the strippers
 To make up for all the lost time
 She could have been one of the bitches
 But she's actually alright

 (Cigarette smoker)
 I'm sorry, but we're all unsure
 How much you've had but
 (We think that you oughta) maybe not have any more

 A country home, even if we really tried
 What if it's just surprises now?
 And I bet your dad would like to give us all a slap
 When are your parents back? D'you know?

 Well I never came from no ghetto
 But it wasn't nowhere near here
 Well-spoken girls in stilettos
 Aren't something to fear

 (Cigarette smoker)
 I'm sorry, but we're all unsure
 How much you've had but
 (We think that you oughta) maybe not have any more

 (Cigarette smoker)
 I'm sorry, but we're all unsure
 How much you've had but

 As well as you think
 And you'd think that it oughta
 Act as the perfect disguise"

Got to be a joker he just do what he please.

He wear no shoeshine he got toe-jam football

One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Come together right now over me.

He bag production he got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease
Come together right now over me.

25,Cornerstone ,"I thought I saw you in The Battleship
But it was only a lookalike
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name

I thought I saw you in The Rusty Hook
Huddled up in wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look
And kissed who ever was sitting there

She was close, and she held me very tightly
Till I asked awfully politely: ""Please
Can I call you her name?""

And I elongated my lift home,
Yeah I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my short cuts to myself

I thought I saw you in The Parrot's Beak
Messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm

It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
""No, you can't call me her name""

Tell me where's your hiding place
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
And I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

I elongated my lift home
Yeah I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my short cuts to myself

I saw your sister in the Cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
I thought she might understand
She was close, well you couldn't get much closer
She said ""I'm really not supposed to but yes,
You can call me anything you want"""
26,Crying Lightning ,"Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude, as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix

Said your mistaken if your thinking that I haven't been called cold before
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
Is all you have left and it was going to waste

Your past-times, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called
Crying lightning
And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons

The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on it's way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never look like yourself from the side
But your profile did not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne

With folded arms you occupy the bench like toothache
Stood and puff your chest out like you never lost a war
And though I try so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

And your past-times, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying lightning
And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons

Uninviting
But not half as impossible as everyone assumes
You are crying lightning

Your past-times, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying lightning
Crying lightning
Crying lightning
Crying lightning

Your past-times, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying"
27,Curtains Close ,"I said I wanted it long but she cut it short
And now I'm catching a cold
I told you not but no crack in the doobie
But it was already rolled

Oh, I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed
I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed
Oh when I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed last night
Oh baby, I must be mad

Well, I don't care about your massage oils
It's got my skin going red
Cause I'm a mad mother-fucker
With my curtains open
Sitting tucked up in bed

I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed
I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed
Oh when I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed last night
Oh baby, I must be mad

I turned down my lights

Oh well, I turned down my lights

28,D is for Dangerous ,"He knew what he wanted to say 
But he did not want to word it
The dirty little Herbert 
Was thinking an escape 
But the place was well guarded
The guiltiness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

D is for Delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare

D is for desperately trying to stimulate 
What it was that was alright 
Three quarters of an hour ago
That had led him to be in a position
On the brink of a mission
On the brink of an episode

He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first, the parallel

Are shitting themselves because there's another name,
Coming to claim what is his to claim,
10% faster with a sturdier frame,
He's certainly come into his own,
There's one on is arm in every land that he roams,
And two consecutive nights alone,
Are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

They said he looks so handsome,
Stood not dancing,
Drawing you in like it's boring to him,
It's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two thing's you'll never be my darling,

Another run around and another push and shove,
Further away from the idea of love,
And his conclusion it must be good,
Or when the penny has dropped with an incredible thud,
Forgot to kick the tin,
He knows where she's going but dunt' know where she's been,
And there's the plus of the other thing,
He'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in,

They said he looks so handsome,
Stood not dancing,
Drawing you in like it's boring to him,
It's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two thing's you'll never be my darling,

But not for this kid, not when they come to you"
30,Dance Little Liar ,"I heard the truth was built to bend.
A mechanism to suspend the guilt is what you will require
and still you've got to dance little liar

It's just like those fibs to pop and fizz
and you'll be forced to take that awful quiz
and you're bound to trip and she'll detect the fiction on your lips
and dig a contradiction up

And the clean coming will hurt
and you can never get it spotless
when there's dirt beneath the dirt
The liar takes a lot less time

I'm sure it's clear and plain to read
It's not an alibi you need just yet
Oh no, it's something for those beads of sweat,
yes that will get you back to normal

And after you have dabbed the patch
you'll breathe and then proceed to scratch the varnish off that newly 
added calmness so as not to raise any alarms too soon

The liar takes a lot less time to decide on the saunter
Have you got itchy bones and in all your time alone
can you hack your mind being riddled with the wrong memories?

And the clean coming will hurt
and you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt between the dirt"

For you to say the first word

So what ya scared for? 
Well don't you always do the same 
It's what ya there for, don't ya know.. 

The lights are flashing 
Down in here tonight 
And some might exchange a glance 
But keep pretending to dance 

Don't act like it's not happening 
As if it's impolite 
To go and mention your name 
Instead you'll just do the same 
As they all do, and hope for the best

The only reason that you came 
So what ya scared for? 
Well don't ya always do the same 
It's what ya there for, but no

32,Dangerous Animals ,"Pinned down by the dark

Been fighting with my sheets and nearly crying in my sleep
Yes I'm battling that well told gripe
The most frustrating type
You should have racing stripes the way you keep me in pursuit
Sharpen the heel of your boot and you press it in my chest
And you make me wheeze
Then to my knees you do promote me

I'm pinned down by the dark
A-N-I-M-A-L
Makes my head pirouette more than I would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S

The light it fidgets through, the thoughts will soon revert to you
About as bashful as a tribal dance
The first and final chance
And cause the audience of the frighteners and fiends
Divided up into two teams
When the acrobat fell off the beam she broke everyone's heart

33,Despair In The Departure Lounge ,"He's pining for her
In a people carrier
There might be buildings and pretty things to see like that
But architecture won't do
Although it might say a lot about the city or town
I don't care what they've got keep on turning them down
It don't say the funny things she does
Don't even try and cheer him up, because
It just won't happen

He's got the feeling again
This time on the aeroplane
There might be tellys in the back of the seats in front
But Rodney and Del won't do
Although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains
Laugh when he falls through the bar
But you're feeling the same
'Cause she isn't there to hold your hand
She won't be waiting for you when you land

It feels like she's just nowhere near
You could well be out on your ear
This thought comes closely followed by the fear
And the thought of it
Makes you feel a bit
Ill

Yesterday I saw a girl
Who looked like someone you might knock about with
And almost shouted
And then reality kicked in within us
It seems as we become the winners
You lose a bit of summat
And half wonder if you won it at all

And don't say 'owt 'cause you've got no idea
And she's still nowhere near
This thought comes closely followed by the fear
And the thought of it
Makes you feel a bit
Ill

Despair in the departure lounge
It's one and they'll still be around at three
No signal and low battery
What's happened to me?"
34,Diamonds are forever ,"Diamonds are forever,
They are all I need to please me,
They can stimulate and tease me,
They won't leave in the night,
I've no fear that they might desert me.

Diamonds are forever,
Hold one up and then caress it,
Touch it, stroke it and undress it,
I can see every part,
Nothing hides in the heart to hurt me.

I don't need love,
For what good will love do me?

Diamonds never lie to me,
For when love's gone,
They'll luster on.


Diamonds are forever,
Sparkling round my little finger.
Unlike men, the diamonds linger;
Men are mere mortals who
Are not worth going to your grave for.



I don't need love,
For what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me,
For when love's gone,
They'll luster on.



Diamonds are forever, forever, forever.
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever.
Forever and ever."
35,Do I Wanna Know ,"Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift 
The type that sticks around like summat* in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've  dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found 
That makes me think of you somehow 
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep spilling drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things 
That you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too 
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open 
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp 
Of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things 
That you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you (crawling back to you)
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (you've had a few)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy) 
Busy being yours to fall for somebody new (busy...)
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you

If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay

That the nights were mainly made for saying things 
That you can't say tomorrow day

Too busy being yours to fall

Ever thought of calling darling?
(Do I wanna know?)
Do you want me crawling back to you?

36,Do me a favour ,"Well the mourning was complete
There was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

It's the beginning of the end, the car went up the hill
And disappeared around the bend, ask anyone they'll tell you that
It's these times that it tends
To start to breaking off, to start to fall apart
Hold on to your heart

Do me a favour and break my nose
Do me a favour and tell me to go away
Do me a favour and stop asking questions

She walked away, well her shoes were untied
And the eyes were all red
You could see that we'd cried, and I watched and I waited
'Till she was inside, forcing a smile and waving goodbye

Curiousity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
Curiousity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

And do me a favour, and ask if you need some help
She said, do me a favour and stop flattering yourself
And to tear apart the ties that bind, perhaps fuck off might be too kind
Perhaps fuck off might be too kind"
37,Don't Forget Whose Legs You're On ,"The painted faces congregate
In the mating season
To second homes
They go alone
In no rush leave 'em
And there's a fountain
And a scimitar
Shaped yellow light
And it picks you up
And cuts you down to size

The people there
And the furniture
Start to seem important
And a whole lot more
You catch the floor
With a vivid and absortant sharpened arc
Like the scimitar
Shaped yellow light
That picks you up
And cuts you down to size

Oh I had questions for the tap dancer
Sat on my lap
And she had child-proof caps on her answers
Stolen blower blow me a stone
And show me that handsome enhancer
She had a rock on her throttle
And a brown glass bottle full of
Shavings from the sun
Although those shoes affect your step
Don't forget whose legs you're on

There's a fountain and a scimitar
Shaped yellow light
And it picks you up
And cuts you down to size"
38,Don't Sit Down 'Cause I've Moved Your Chair ,"Break a mirror, roll the dice
Run with scissors through a chip pan fire fight
Go into business with a grizzly bear
But just don’t sit down cause I’ve moved your chair

Find a well known hard man and start a fight
Wear your shell suit on bonfire night
Fill in a circular hole with a peg that’s square
But just don’t sit down cause I’ve moved your chair

Oooh yeah yeah yeah

Bite the lightning and tell me how it tastes
Kung fu fighting on your rollerskates
Do the macarena in the devil’s lair
But just don’t sit down cause I’ve moved your chair

Oooh yeah yeah yeah"

Be my baby, be my GTO
Call me something no one else calls me

Well, my heart was breaking and got left unlocked
Didn’t see you sneak in, but I’m glad you stopped
Tell me something I don’t already know
Like how'd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity?

Love like locked horns, love like dominos
Be my midnight, be my ebb and flow
I forget how I want it, how it crept up on me
It takes over, electricity

And my heart was breaking and got left unlocked
Didn’t see you sneak in, but I’m glad you stopped
Tell me something I don’t already know
Like how'd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity?

Separated, there I face it
Love like thunder, love like falling snow

Tell me something I don’t already know
Like how'd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity?"
40,Evil Twin ,"You've never met before

Both start talking at the exact same time
Trying to think of ways to make her mine
But they're difficult to find

It's not what I need
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me

And she said: ""Oh, well I knew this will sound cold
But I really have to go
Oh, it's not that I'm not free
There's nowhere I need to be
It's just your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me""

It's not what I need
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me

She said: ""Baby, how can I believe you
How can I believe you when you can't believe your luck?""
No point sticking to the plan when it's going slow

It's more a hunger than a thirst
You'll break it out the second time
Before you know about the first
Looks well-equipped to leave you in the lurch
But you'll let her do her worst

And it's not hard to tell
It's obvious the other angels' faces fell
When she told them that she had to go
Troubled wings and overcoat for something colorful
Tha' knows

It's not what I need
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me

All wishing they weren't there

And as the microphone squeaks
A young girl's telephone beeps
Yeah she's dashing for the exit
she's running to the streets outside
""Oh you've saved me,"" she screams down the line
""The band was f**king wank
And I'm not having a nice time""

I don't want to hear you 
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't wanna hear, you know
(Kick me out, kick me out)
Yeah but his bird thinks it's amazing, though
So all that's left
Is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

He talks of San Francisco, he's from Hunter's Bar
I don't quite know the distance
But I'm sure that's far

 It feels like I only go backwards, baby

 I got my hopes up again, no no, not again

I'll meet you there 

Am I snapping the excitement 
If I pack away the laguther 
And tell you how it feels 

And does burden come to meet ya

And you lived there so long it’s kinda strange now you’re gone

I’m not sure if I should show you what I’ve found
Has it gone for good or is it coming back around?
Isn’t it hard to make up your mind
When you’re losing and your fuse is fireside

There’s all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on Memory Lane you liked 
Still looks the same but something about it’s changed

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you’re losing and your fuse is fireside

And I thought I was yours forever
Maybe I was mistaken
But I just cannot manage to make it through the day

My love when you dreamed them up

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she tells she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle

And in the last sip you and I
Declared we might require a breather


I am the truth true through and I
Can feign excitement fluently
As solid as I can busk shock


With well presented merriment
And I know all too well
I shouldn't break the key off in the lock

And the tumble splits the frame, revealing silken fits
In the fright lined dining room
Throw a gaze towards them while they feast


The days drag their heels when you're not there to crack the whip
And the weeks wait to burst like a sachet of brass

The old pantomime villian follows my coat
And he hides where it hangs and he spies through the slats


And meanwhile in the desert's only costume shop
The cowls hang and wait to rot away the identities of the willing

Drowned bags of sugar in the night
Rocketing shuttered doors despite
The shop not opening for hours

You can itch, flap, and whistle
And try to avoid the talk
As I scribbled over drivel you were snoring, showing off

The tumble splits the frame, revealing silken fits
In the fright lined dining room
Throw a gaze towards them while they feast"
48,From Ritz To The Rubble ,"Last night these two bouncers
And one of em's alright
The other one's the scary one
His way or no way, totalitarian
He's got no time for you
Looking or breathing
How he dosen’t want you to
So step out the queue
He makes examples of you
And there's nowt you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realize then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line
And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant?
Why can't they have a laugh?
He's got his hand in your chest
He wants to give you a duff
Well secretly I think they want it all to kick off
They want, arms flying everywhere and
Bottles as well it's just
Something to talk about
A story to tell you

Well I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate

I thought a thousand million things that I could never think this morning

Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

This town's a different town today
This town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday

That girl's a different girl today
That girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday

Last night what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore"
49,Golden Trunks ,"Last night when my psyches 
Subcommittee sang to me in it's scary voice
You slowly dropped your eyelids
When true love takes a grip it leaves you without a choice

And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit sometimes I fantasize about you too

The leader of the free world 
Reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks
He's got himself a theme tune
They play it for him as he makes his way to the ring

And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit sometimes I fantasize about you too

And in a daytime
Bendable figures with a fresh new pack of lies
Summat else to publicise

I'm sure you've heard about enough
So in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit sometimes I fantasize about you too"
50,Hello You ,"Lego Napoleon movie written in noble gas-filled glass tubes underlined in sparks
I'll admit it's elaborate for a waking thought
Vortex to vortex, The Business they call Show
Hasn't ever been this pumped up before
Hello Gruesome, there's just enough time left to swing by and re-address the start
If you call and have them pull around the car and stop specialising in stories from the road

Hello you
Still dragging out a long goodbye?
I ought to apologise
For one of the last times

As that meandering chapter reaches its end and leaves us in a thoughtful little daze
This electric warrior's motorcade shall burn no more rubber down that boulevard
Read the message I left on the thank you card
Overtaking the tractor, waiting for sets of winds and bends to level out again
Picking your moment along a country lane
The kind where the harmonies feel right at home

Hello you
Still dragging out a long goodbye?
I ought to apologise
For one of the last times

Taking a dive into your crystal ball
I've snorkelled on the beaches fruitlessly
Why not rewind to Rawborough Snooker Club?
I could pass for seventeen if I
Just get a shave and catch some Zzz"

52,I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am ,"Freaky keypad by the retina scan
And I've been given good reason to believe
I ain't quite where I think I am
But it's always worth half of that
You know the face but you can't see past
The disco strobes in the stumbling blocks
Wait, there's the other island now

Formation displays of affection fly over (eyes roll back)
And I can see both islands now

It's the intermission
Let's shake a few hands
Blank expressions invite me to suspect
I ain't quite where I think I am
Stackable party guests
To fill the awkward silеnces
The disco strobes in thе stumbling blocks
Wait, there's the other island now

Formation displays of affection fly over (Eyes roll back)
And I can see both islands now

From my vantage point
A spare set of tingles will race up your spine, if I get it my way

Looks like the Riviera
Is coming into land
Early predictions would seem to suggest
I ain't quite where I think I am

Formation displays of affection flying over (Eyes roll back)
And I can see both islands now"

Because you're sending me to despair.

A fraud,
A fraud,
Someone's perception, trying not to bore
Im a cold-hearted kidda,
Applaud
Applaud
If you're the highest bidder, I'm yours

You figure out pathetic sets
We're not sure of the etiquette
We think out pathetic sets

We're not sure of the etiquette

And if you found this it's probably too late
Clinically cynical, hereditary hate
If you found this it's probably too late
Approaching the pinnacle and running out of mates

If we concentrate on being off the cuff
Not sure we're ready but probably rough
Frightened that honesty isn't enough
And it's nothing on the early stuff "

And take the swords to the innocents

If you were there, beware
The serpent soul pinchers
Can't you sense she was never meant to fill column inches
Haven’t you had enough, what you're trying to dig up isn't there to be dug
The thieves help the thugs 
As they're trying beat the good grace of a sweetheart
Out to the point she'll comply

Why leave her on her own?

I wouldn't have said it, if I would have known
Why leave her on her own?
If I predicted tears then I wouldn't have said it

Or are you just happy to sit there and watch
While the paint job dries?
When it's over, you're supposed to know
Lights out on the Wonderpark
Your sawtoothed lover boy was quick off the mark
That's long enough in the sunshine for one night
Didn't recognise you through the smoke
Pyjama pants and a Subbuteo cloak
You know that it's alright if you wanna cry
Is there something on your mind
Or are you just happy to sit there and watch
While the paint job dries?
When it's over, you're supposed to know

And the bows on the shoes you kicked off
I'm joining the dots
I'm joining the dots

I thought I heard them talking in their sleep yesterday
And I tried but I just can't believe a word they say
Hurry up, they'll be here soon, sleeping in the afternoon
While the rain is trying to prove a point outside

From the smoke in your hair to the blood in your bruise
And the bows on the shoes you kicked off
I'm joining the dots
I'm joining the dots

Can't the flame come up to the moth for a change?
Darling if it's all the same to you, I'll have you to myself

Elevating higher as my body's moving lower
Now I've reached my element you better move over

I try to push past but he wants to play
So I sip his drink as I hold his gaze

As we erupt in to the room
I feel the sub go boom
A feeling easy to resume
This right here I swear will end too soon
Sinking to the tune
As I inhale the fumes
A feeling easy to resume
This right here I swear will end to soon

My limbs seem to move what the beat dictates to me
I push in to the middle the sound becomes a part of me
Taking me back to that sweet familiarity
Watching my adrenalin rise I feel the eyes on me

Sip the bottle now don't be slow
Keep up with me as we lose control
Keep up with me as we lose control

As we erupt in to the room
I feel the sub go boom
A feeling easy to resume
This right here I swear will end too soon
Sinking to the tune
As I inhale the fumes
A feeling easy to resume"
64,Knee Socks ,"You got the lights on in the afternoon
And the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissing to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue

And you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

When the zeros line up on the twenty four hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Well you cured my January blues
Yeah you made it all alright
I got a feeling I might have lit the very fuse
That you were trying not to light

You were a stranger in my phone book I was acting like I knew
'Cause I had nothing to lose
When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
Ain't it funny what you'll do?

When the zeros line up on the twenty four hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

The late afternoon the ghost in your room 
That you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
Never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot 
By the scruff of your knee socks

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby

When the zeros line up on the twenty four hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks"

Just hit me one more time with that live wire

You want to throw me away but I'm not broken

Or, darling, have you started feeling old yet?
Don't worry, I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
With the efficiency that only youth can harness
And do you still think love is a laserquest
Or do you take it all more seriously?
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make-believe

And do you look in to the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or has somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered?
When I'm not being honest I pretend that you were just some lover

Now I can't think of there without thinking of you
I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide
And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
And I convince myself I need another
For a minute it gets easier to pretend that you were just some lover

When I'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
Singing dreadful songs about summer
Will I have found a better method of pretending you were just some lover? 
Will I have found a better method of pretending you were just some lover?"

I see your frown
And it's like looking down the barrel of a gun
And it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer

It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Now then Mardy Bum
Oh, I'm in trouble again, aren't I?
I thought as much
Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bear

Why can't we just laugh and joke around?
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

And yeah, I'm sorry I was late
Well I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
That reoccurs, oh when you say I don't care
But of course I do, yeah I clearly do!

So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Still it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on"
74,Matador ,"She was marrying the Matador and he was with the weather girl
A very clever girl who stood out amongst several ones
A terrible dillema and forever he'll regret the day he didn't make
The rescue from the bullring
Sulking won't get you nowhere son
There's blood on your chin where you've bitten your tongue
Smitten but might not be smitten for long
If you're still sitting she'll soon be smitten and gone"
75,Mr Schwartz ,"Put your heavy metal to the test
Might be half a love song in it all for you
Timing wise it's probably for the best
Come here and kiss me now before it gets too cute

Mr. Schwartz is staying strong for the crew
Wardrobe's lint rolling your velveteen suit
And smudging dubbin on your dancing shoes

Gradually it's coming into view
It's like your little directorial debut
As fine a time as any to deduce
The fact that neither you or I has ever had a clue

Mr. Schwartz is staying strong for the crew
Wardrobe's lint rolling your velveteen suit
And smudging dubbin on your dancing shoes

And if we guess who I'm pretending to be
Do we win a prize?
Having attempted twice, both incorrectly
Do we get a third try?

The gloved hand's reaching in to hit the switch
And there's not one goddam thing that you can do about it

Mr. Schwartz is having tea with the grips
Asking after all the wives and the kids
It's at the heart of what The Business is"
76,My Propeller ,"If you can summon the strength, tow me

It's a necessary evil 
No cause for emergency 
Borrow the beak of a bald eagle 
Oh, momentary synergy 

Coax me out, my love 
Sink into tomorrow 
Coax me out, my love 
And have a spin of my propeller 

My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own 
When are you arriving?

I was looking but can't find it anywhere
They always offer when there's loads of love around
But, when you're short of some, it's nowhere to be found

Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday
No chance, you'll get nothin' from me
But now she's there, you're there, and everybody's there
He's in turmoil, as puzzled as can be
Just like me

Let's go down, down, low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh and she thinks she's the one
But she's just one in 24
And just 'cause everybody's doin' it
Does that mean that I can, too?

Lady, where has your love gone?
It was the anti-septic to the sore
To hold you by the hand
Must he first be in demand?
How he longs for you to long for him once more
Just once more

Let's go down, down, low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh and she thinks she's the one
But she's just one in 24
And just 'cause everybody's doin' it
Does that mean that I can, too? Oh...

Her eyes went down and cut you up
And there's nothing like a dirty look from
The one you want, or the one you've lost

An ache in your soul is everybody's goal
To get what they can't have
That's why you're after her
And that's why she's after him
But sayin' it won't change a thing
And no realising it won't change a thing
Realising it wont change a thing"
78,No. 1 Party Anthem ,"So you’re on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not
Leather jacket collar popped like antenna, 
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course,
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles


Call off the search for your soul, or put it on hold again
She’s having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this her oldest friends,
Sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes 
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach 
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat 
That you just swallowed have got you going

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

She’s a certified mind blower, knowing full well that I don’t
May suggest that there’s somewhere from which I might know her 
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It’s not like I’m falling in love I just want you to do me no good
And you look like you could

Come on, come on, come on 
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem

The look of love - the rush of blood
The “She’s with me” - The Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs - the Camera Plus
The black & white - the colour dodge
The good time girls - the cubicles
The house of fun - the number one
Party anthem

Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem"

That the emperors were trapped in the cage
And the days she being dull
Leading to nights reading beer bottles

You're such a fugitive

You're at a loss, just because
It wasn't all that you thought it was
You are a fugitive

I thought it was dark outside 

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wondering whether later, when you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

Bear with me man, I lost my train of thought

I fantasise, I call it quits
I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits
The chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks
Thirsty for blood

Just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritized
And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five

Such beautiful photography, it's worth it for the opening scene

Make no mistake, no

And even if somehow we could have 
Shown you the place you wanted
Well, I’m sure you could have made it that bit 
Better on your own

And I bet she told a million people 
That she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises they don’t mean much 
When there’s memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by new year's eve
They made it far too easy to believe 
That true romance can't be achieved these days

Only you know
What you have been through
There's better things
You're gonna get into

A revelation or your money back

When my invincible streak turns onto the final straight

That might be a surprise, but it's true
So I'm not like you and I don't want your advice
Or your praise or to move in the ways you do.
And I never will.

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

Full of confusion. Your snarl is just so condescending.
Try to explain that we're onto a win
If the fee we get in near recoups what we're spending.

And covered them with goo

He wants to put them on you and it hurts my back

Because the only thing that's as heavy as the adoration
Is the days of hanging out on his own
And it's been a long-sounding alarm
And he frightened me to death

Past the square, past the bridge
past the mills, past the stacks

tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all of those dreams

He'll reach deep into the hole,
heal your shrinking soul
And there won't be a single thing

Across this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
is a red right hand

You don't have no money?
He'll get you some
If you haven't got no car, 
He'll get you one
You've got no self-respect,
you feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy,
cause here he comes
Through the ghetto and the barrio
and the bowery and the slums

A shadow is cast 
wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his
red right hand

You'll see him in your nightmares,
you'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
he's not what he seems
You'll see him in your head and
on the TV screen
hey buddy, I'm warning
you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god,
he's a man, he's a guru

You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
his red right hand"
98,Riot Van ,"Up rolls the riot van
and sparks excitement in the boys
But the policemen look annoyed
Perhaps these are ones they should avoid

We got a chase last night
from men with truncheons dressed in hats
We didn't do that much wrong
still ran away though for the laugh
Just for the laugh

And please just stop talking
Cause they won't find us if you do
Oh, those silly boys in blue
Well, they won't catch me and you

Have you been drinking, son?
You don't look old enough to me
I'm sorry officer is there 
a certain age you're supposed to be?
Cause nobody told me

And up rolls the riot van
And these lads just wind the coppers up
They ask why they don't catch proper crooks
They got their address and their names took
But they couldn't care less

Thrown in the riot van
And all the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win
Just had to take it on the chin"
99,Sandtrap ,"When you leave us through the patient doors
That rattle in you ear will be the sound of our applause
Rapturous, considered and due
Oh the nasty laughter and desperate smirks
Are tangled in the boredom where out brittle kisses lurk
Well how can i believe you, when you can't believe your luck

And the shards of past attraction lie visible
But shy and blunt and weak and worn
Away by whining in the emery paper voice you use to speak

Oh the shards of past attraction lie visible
But shy and blunt and weak and worn
Away by whining in the emery paper voice you use to speak

In the trap
You only want to be the first to laugh
You only want to be the first in the sandtrap
You only want to be the first to laugh

And your climbing holes and sink the claws
We know i do clenching that you send us all towards

Farewell, farewell, farewell"
100,Science Fiction ,"Religious iconography giving you the creeps?
I feel rougher than a disco lizard tongue along your cheek
The rise of the machines
I must admit you gave me something momentarily
In which I could believe
But the hand of harsh reality’s un-gloved
And it’s on its way back to scoop you up
Not on my watch

I want to stay with you my love
The way that some science fiction does reflections in
The silver screen of strange societies
Swamp monster with a hard on for connectivity

The ascension of the cream
Mass panic on a not too distant future colony
Quantitative easing
I want to make a simple point about peace and love
But in a sexy way where it’s not obvious
Highlight dangers and send out hidden messages
The way some science fiction does

I’ve got the world on a wire in my little mirror mirror on the wall
In the pocket of my raincoat
So I tried to write a song to make you blush
But I’ve a feeling that the whole thing
May well just end up too clever for its own good
The way some science fiction does"
101,Sculptures Of Anything Goes ,"How am I supposed to manage my infallible beliefs
While I'm sockin' it to ya?
Performing in Spanish on Italian TV
Sometime in the future
Whilst wondering if your mother still ever thinks of me
Hallelujah

Blank canvasses lent against gallery walls
Flowing towards sculptures of Anything Goes
On the marble stairs

Is that vague sense of longing kinda trying to cause a scene?
Guess I'm talking to you now
Puncturing your bubble of relatability
With your horrible new sound
Baby, those mixed messages ain't what they used to be
When you said 'em out loud

Blank canvasses lent against gallery walls
Flowing towards sculptures of Anything Goes
On the marble stairs
Leading to almost wherever you want them to

The simulation cartridge for City Life '09
Is pretty tricky to come by
Village coffee mornings with not long since retired spies
Now that's my idea of a good time
Flash that angle grinder smile, gasp and roll your eyes
And help me to get untied from the chandelier
And twizzling 'round an umbrella
I'll sing a tune"
102,Secret Door ,"Fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
That you would rather be beside than in front of
But she’s never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares

She swam out of tonight’s phantasm, grabbed my hand and made it very clear
There’s absolutely nothing for us here
It’s a magnolia celebration to be attempted on a Wednesday night
It’s better that than get a reputation as a miserable little tyke
At least that’s the conclusion she came to in this overture

And the secret door swings behind us,
She’s saying nothing, she’s just giggling along

Her arms were folded the most indignant not looking like she was soon to leave
I had to squint in order to believe.
And then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf and unveiling the unexpected
I who was earlier reluctant was suddenly embarrassed and corrected
How could such a creature survive in such a habitat?

And the secret door swings behind us,
She’s saying nothing, she’s just giggling along
And even if they were to find us I wouldn’t notice,
I’m completely occupied

As all the fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
Ones you would rather be beside than in front of
But she’s never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares
Fools on parade frolic and fuck about to make her gaze
Turn to a scribble on a page by a picture that holds her absence
But you’re daft to think she’d care

Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Fools on parade conduct a sing-along"
103,Settle For A Draw ,"Well I watch you tangle every weekend
It might start different but it ends up the same
One minute you're casually speaking
The next it all goes up and you pour fuel on the flame
With your Jerry can of words and tones

And no one's gonna start a revolution
So we best leave it well alone
And there's something that Frankie used to say, Apparently
Oh he says settle for a draw
Well you're not gonna get no more
So you should settle for a draw
I told you once I'm sure
I told you once I'm sure
You should settle for a draw
Why don't you settle for a draw?

Well you're right it is one set of rules for her
And then another set for you
But that's just the way it is I suppose
And there's nowt you can do
And lets not fall in the trap
Of Answering back
I am just a beginner
But she'll be the only winner
That's for sure
So take the draw, if it's available
And if it sets on fire don't get out your jerry can of...
...words and tones

And no one's gonna start a revolution
So we best leave it well alone
And there's something that Frankie used to say, Apparently
Oh he says settle for a draw
Well you're not gonna get no more
So you should settle for a draw
I told you once I'm sure
I told you once I'm sure
You should settle for a draw
Why don't you settle for a draw?"
104,She Looks Like Fun ,"One, two, three, four

She looks like fun
She looks like fun
She looks like fun
She looks like

Smile like you've got a straw in something tropical
I've got the party plugged right into my skull
Wayne Manor, what a memorable N.Y.E

(She looks like fun)
Good morning
(She looks like fun)
Cheeseburger
(She looks like fun)
Snowboarding
(She looks like)

Finally, I can share with you through cloudy skies
Every whimsical thought that enters my mind
There ain't no limit to the length of the dickheads we can be

[Chorus]
(She looks like fun)
Bukowski
(She looks like fun)
Dogsitting
(She looks like fun)
Screwballing
(She looks like)

Finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue
Baby, but why can't we all just get along?
Dance as if somebody's watching, because they are

No one's on the streets
We moved it all online
As of March
I'm so full of shite, I need to spend less time stood around in bars waffling on to strangers all about martial arts
And how much I respect them

(She looks like fun)
Key changes
(She looks like fun)
Re-thinking
(She looks like fun)
New order
(She looks like fun)"
105,She's Thunderstorms ,"She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

I've been feeling foolish
You should try it
She came and substituted
The peace and quiet for
Acrobatic blood flow
Concertina cheating heart beat
Rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Here is your host
Sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns
She's trunderstorms

She's been loop the looping
Around my mind
Her motorcycle boots give me
This kind of acrobatic blood
Concertina cheating heart beat
Rapid fire 

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall

She's thunderstorms
In an unusual place
When you're feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day"
106,Sketchead ,"He's coming to your party
He's walking up your drive 
And he's swinging all his keys round
Sketchead
He's seen you with your top off
He already knows your boyfriend 
retain your introductions
Sketchead
That cunt's a protagonist
The pips in your quince
They are behind the spoil
The itch you can't itch in your ear
And the knock that shattered your packet of peppermints

Sketchead
There's poison in his spit
He'll compliment your tits
And leave you to your wits

Convincingly insisting the tyres were bald 
when you gave him the car
Sketchead
Still coming to your party
Still walking up your drive
And still swinging all his keys round on his finger
As a pendulum to un nerve

And then there's you
You've changed
I approach you like you were the same
But soon it was apparent a new name was required
New lips went and fired accomplishments at me
While I'm captivated by your magazine skin
The tint on your limbs is obscures to begin
And you know full well
That anyone who says that
They don't prefer the sequel
Will still be swinging on themselves tonight"
107,Snap Out Of It ,"What's been happening in your world?
What have you been up to?
I heard that you fell in love or near enough
I gotta tell you the truth yeah

I want to grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)

If that watch don't continue to swing 
Or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settling down or giving up
But it don't sound much like you girl

I want to grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)

If that watch don't continue to swing 
Or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Under a spell you're hypnotized
Darling how could you be so blind?

I want to grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)

If that watch don't continue to swing 
Or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it"
108,Space Invaders ,"Space invaders flying home
And they're going to hit the sack
And they're probably gonna die getting high
'Cause they're mixing crazy moments with the crack

And she's kissing all the boys
But she's too clever to be slack
But she's bound to go away for a day
And she' like it, so she won't be coming back

Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days have died
Baby, baby, baby
Now won't you dry your pretty eyes?
Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days are dead
So come on

Spot big bell bottom cords
And a matching with a hat
And you're a rule breaker, baby
Can't you see me standing
Only in your way to hit the sack?

And she's kissing all the boys
But she's too clever to be slack
But she's bound to go away for a day
And she' like it, so she won't be coming back

Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days have died
Baby, baby, baby
Now won't you dry your pretty eyes?
Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days are dead
So come on"
109,Star Treatment ,"I just wanted to be one of The Strokes
Now look at the mess you made me make
Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space
Ask your mates but golden boy's in bad shape
I found out the hard way that here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a bridge floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984 2019

Maybe I was a little too wild in the 70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
Karate bandana
Warp speed chic
Hair down to there
Impressive moustache
Love came in a bottle with a twist off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

So who you gonna call?
The martini police baby that isn't how they look tonight
It took the light forever to get to your eyes

I just wanted to be one of those ghosts you thought that you could forget and then I haunt you via the rear view mirror on a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright because you love me and you recognise that it's ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly so pull over
I know the place don't know an apparition is a cheap date
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner
Long hot summer
They've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

Maybe I was a little too wild in the 70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make believe residency from the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day four nights a week
Easy money

So who you gonna call?
The martini police baby that isn't how they look tonight
It took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes
And as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
It's the star treatment"
110,Stickin' To The Floor ,"Won't somebody let me out!
Don't wanna stick around no more
I said they're looking at yer strange
I said yer stickin' to the floor

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in yer
So now one of you's gonna have to stop!

Fucking hell I'll break your nose
If they keep on pushing you around
Keep on steeping on your toes
I'll pick you up when you fall down

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in yer
Said not one of you, no

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in yer
So now one of you's gonna have to stop!

Said not one of you, no"
111,Still Take You Home ,"Oh it's ever so funny
I don't think you're special
I don't think you're cool
You're just probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful

And I'm strugglin'
I can't see through your fake tan
Yeah, you know it for a fact
That everybody's eatin' out of your hands

But what do you know?
Oh you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Said you don't know nothing

Well fancy seein' you in here
You're all tarted up
And you don't look the same
Well I haven't seen you since last year
Yeah surprisingly
You have forgot my name

But you know it
Yeah, you knew it all along
Oh you say you have forgotten
But you're fibbing
Go on tell me I'm wrong

So what do you know?
Oh you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Oh you don't know nothing, no

I say what do you know?
That you don't know nothing, no
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
I said what do you know?
Oh you don't know nothing

I fancy you with a passion
You're a Topshop princess, a rockstar too
But you're a fad, you're a fashion
And I'm having a job trying to talk to you

But it's alright, yeah I'll put it all on one-side
Oh 'cause everybody's looking
You've got control of everyone's eyes
Including mine"
112,Stop The World I Wanna Get Off With You ,"Open Sesame (We've places to go)
We've people to see (Let's put 'em on hold*)
There's all sorts of shapes, that I bet you can make
When you want to escape say the word

Well I know, that getting you alone isn't easy to do
With the exception of you I dislike everyone in the room
And I don't wanna lie, but I don't wanna tell you the truth
Get the sense that you're on the move
And you'll probably be leaving soon, so I'm telling you

Stop the world cause I wanna get off with you
Stop the world cause I wanna get off with you

Eyes the colour of (Water left in mud)
Icing sugar dust (Crazy green flashes)
It's a funny thing, that I cannot explain
Don't you know the train keeps a-rolling?

Stop the world cause I wanna get off with you
Stop the world cause I wanna get off with you

Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
And I don't wanna lie and I don't wanna tell you the truth
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see
Think we both oughta put 'em on hold and I know you agree

Stop the world cause I wanna get off with you
Stop the world cause I wanna get off with you"
113,Strange (cover Patsy Cline) ,"Strange, how you stopped loving me
How you stopped needing me
When she came along
Oh, how strange

Strange, you changed like night and day
Just up and walked away
When she came along
Oh, how strange

Well, I guess that I was just your puppet
You held on a string
To think I thought you really loved me
But look what thoughts can bring

Strange, you're still in all my dreams
Oh what a funny thing
I still care for you
Oh, how strange

Strange, you're still in all my dreams
Oh what a funny thing
I still care for you
Oh, how strange

How strange"
114,Suck It And See ,"Your love is like a studded leather headlock
Your kiss... it could put creases in the rain
You're rarer than a can of Dandelion & Burdock
And those other girls are just postmix lemonade

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I'm a fool for you

I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun
And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go 
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I'm a fool for you

Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says:
""Baby, I was made to break your heart""

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Go
Go
Go

Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I'm a fool for you"
115,Take It Or Leave It ,"Leave me alone
I'm in control, I'm in control
And girls act too much and boys act too tough
Enough is enough

We're on the minds of other men I know she was
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, take it

I say, hes going to let you down
He's going to let you down
He's going to let you down
And going to break your back for a chance
And going to steal your friends if he can
He's going to win someday

I fell off the track
Now I can't go back
I'm not like that
Boys act too much, girls act too tough
Enough is enough

Well on the minds of other girls iIknow he was
I said just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, take it

I say, he's going to let you down

Oh he will"
116,Teddy Picker ,"They've sped up to the point where they provoke 
The punch-line before they have told the joke
Plenty of desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen

They've sped up to the point where they provoke you
To tell the fucking punch-line before you have told the joke 
I'm sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist 
It wasn't in the top 100 list

It's the 1000th time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you but you were dying for it

Saw it and she grabbed it and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means

Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
D'you reckon that they do it for a joke?
D'you reckon that they make them take an oath 
That says that ""We are defenders 
Of any poser or professional 
Pretender around""

When did your list 
Replace the twist and turn like a fist
Replaced a kiss, don't concern 
Us with your bollocks
I don't want your prayer 
Save it for the morning after

And it's the 1000th time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you but you were gagging for it

Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough can I have it quicker
Already thick and your getting thicker

Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough can I have it quicker
Already thick and your getting thicker

Presuming all things are equal 
Who'd want to be man of the people
When there's people like you"
117,Temptation Greets You Like Your Naughty Friend ,"[Alex Turner]
I don't ever want to hate you,
So don't show me your bed,
The only roads are cul-de-sacs,
The first thing that she said.

Temptation, greets you like your naughty mate,
The one that used to get you in bother,
But one you could never bring yourself to hate.

And she said we've got that spark,
That only lights a fuse,
Helps you see in the dark,
But it's a sight you'll lose when,
The temptation greets you like your naughty friend.

I don't ever want to hate you,
So don't show me your bed,
The only roads are cul-de-sacs,
The only ends are dead.

Temptation greets you like your naughty mate,
One that made you steal and set things on fire,
But one you haven't seen of late.

And I said that kind of talk,
Only adds intrigue,
To the cauldron of thought,
It's already exceeding,
Temptation, the very thing that held her back.

I don't ever want to hate you,
So don't show me your bed,
The only roads are cul-de-sacs,
The only ends are dead.

I don't ever want to hate you,
It's not part of the plan,
So keep your charm where I can't see it,

And your hands where I can.

[Dizzee Rascal]
We used to be in tight me and my naughty friends,
Caused bare madness in the ends,
I mean day 'n' night,
We robbed, we stole, we loved to fight,
Smoking, drinking, joyriding,
Drugs, thugs, not law-abiding,
Reckless gangsters no direction,
No sign of correction,
But then i switched it up,
Changed my ways,
What the hell!
Like oh my days ,
But like my naughty friends,
They're not phased,
Can't believe that this music pays,
See no reason why we can't do,
All the things we've always done,
Still in my heart I know thats just what,
But its hard to fight the temptation son.

[Alex Turner]
The panic will fall down around you,
If you don't do what i say.

I don't ever want to hate you,
So don't show me your bed,
The only roads are cul-de-sacs,
The only ends are dead.

I don't ever want to hate you,
It's not part of the plan,
So keep your charm where I can't see it,
And your hands where I can."
118,That’s Where You’re Wrong ,"Pussyfooting setting sun
Make a wish that weighs a tonne
There are no handles for you to hold
No understanding where it goes

Jealousy in technicolour
Fear by name love by numbers
Street lamps amber wanderlust
Powder in a blunderbus

She looks as if she’s blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don’t take it so personally
You’re not the only one
That time's got it in for honey
That’s where you’re wrong

All the old flames fastened on
Make a wish that weighs a tonne
There are no handles you can hold
And no understanding where it goes

She looks as if she’s blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don’t take it so personally
You’re not the only one
That time's got it in for honey
That’s where you’re wrong
That’s where you’re wrong
That’s where you’re wrong, oh"
119,The Afternoon's Hat ,"Made me kiss ya' with a whisper
And violently you swung, through unfamiliar tounge
Couldn't listen to tradition, grabbed me by the wrist to silently insist

And when i'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoons hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

You stood shirtless and confident
Listenin' to the fools, tickling the rules
Their obsessions follow patterns
Sat upon their stools, with their attitudes

And when i'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoons hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

And when i'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoons hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at."
120,The Bad Thing ,"Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it 
That much easier
It might make it worse

Oh the nights like a whirlwind
Somebody's girlfriend's talkin to me 
But it's alright, she's sayin that
He's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
He's not the jealous type

And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away
But when there's no excuses that's much easier to say
I've been before
And all these capers makers to good for her to ignore
So she's talkin but I'm not entirely sure

Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it 
That much easier
It might make it worse

I'm stood at the side
And somebody's partner's talkin to me
But I don't know that is what she is
And she murmors things to confirm
That the tragedy is true
And I knew how could she not 
She could have anyone she wants
And I was strugglin to think of an immediate response

Like ""I don't mind
Be a big mistake
For you to wait
And let me waste your time
Really love, it's fine""
Said ""really love, it's fine""

And then the first time it occured 
That there was something to destroy
I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
Oh but she carried on suggestin
I struggled to refuse
She said ""it's the red wine this time but that is no excuse"""
121,The Bakery ,"I wish you would have smiled in the bakery
Or sat on a tatty settee
At some mutual friend's gathering
And the more you keep on looking the more it's hard to take
Love, we're in stalemate
To never meet it surely where we're bound
There's one in every town
Just there to grind you down

I wish I would have seen you in the post office
Well maybe I did and I missed it
Too busy with a mind on clever lines
Why not the rounder's pitch or the canteen?
You're slacking love where have you been?
Just had to go and wait until tonight
So give me the invite don't worry it's alright

I wish I would have seen you down in the arcade
Sipping on a lemonade
In the paper cup and chewing on the straw
And I wish I'd seen you in the bakery
But if I'd seen you in the bakery
You probably wouldn't have seen me"
122,The Blond,"Black as a beacon 
In a river of shimmering fog
Yes she was
If you were heat seeking 
She was hard to ignore
Yes she was

And she snapped wing mirrors off a Cadillac
The particularly pretty one
And that meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on

Well time tastes bland
When she's not around
And you'd sit and you'd sink and approach the brink
Before she showed you how to shake love's steady hand
Tha' knows

And she snapped wing mirrors off a Cadillac
The particularly pretty one
And that meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on

Shake love's steady hand
Shake love's steady
She floats like an niccy rush but she stings like a b-flat
The blond-o-sonic shimmer trap

And she snapped wing mirrors off a Cadillac
The particularly pretty one
And that meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on"
123,The Car ,"Your grandfather's guitar
Thinking about how funny I must look
Trying to adjust to what's been there all along
With the boat kiosk lady and her sleepy amigos
But it ain't a holiday until
You go to fetch something from the car
A travel size champagne cork pops
And we're sweeping for bugs in some dusty apartment
The what's it called café
You can arrive at eleven and have lunch with the English
But it ain't a holiday until
They force you to make a wish
They say ""climb up this""
And ""jump off that""
And you pretend to fall asleep on the way back
No, it ain't a holiday until
You go to fetch something from the car"
124,The Fire And The Thud ,"You showed me my tomorrow 
Beside a box of matches 
A welcome threatening stir 

My hopes of being stolen 
Might just ring true 
Depends who you prefer 

But if it's true you're gonna run away 
Tell me where 
I'll meet you there 

Am I snapping the excitement 
If I pack away the laguther 
And tell you how it feels 

And does burden come to meet ya 
If I've questions of the feature that runs on your dream wheel 

The day after you stole my heart, 
Everything I touched told me it would be better shared with you 

And you're hiding in my soup 
And the book reveals your face 
And there's a splashing in my eyelids 
The concentration continually breaks 

I did request the mark you cast 
Didn't heal as fast 
I hear your vioce in silences 
Will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud? 

And the jostling crowd 
You're not allowed to tell the truth 
And the photobooth's a liar 
And the sharpened explanations 
But theres no screaming reason to inquire 
I'd like to poke them in their prying eyes with things they never see if it smacks in their temples"
125,The Hellcat Spangled Shalala ,"Just when things are getting complicated in the eye of the storm
She flicks a red-hot revelation off the tip of her tongue
It does a dozen somersaults and leaves you supercharged
Makes me want to blow the candles out just to see if you glow in the dark

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

Home sweet home, home sweet home, home sweet booby-trap
I took the batteries out my mysticism and put ‘em in my thinking cap
She’s got a telescopic hallelujah  hanging up on the wall
For when it gets too complicated in the eye of the storm

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

Oh…

And in a hellcat spangled cavern
When your judgement’s on the run
And you’re acting like a stranger 
Because you thought it looked like fun

And did you ever get the feeling 
That these are things she's said before
Her steady hands may well have done the devil’s pedicure

What you waiting for?
Sing another fuckin’ Shalalala 

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala"
126,The Jeweller's Hands ,"Fiendish wonder in the carnival's wake
Dull caresses once again irritate
Tread softly stranger
Move over toward the danger that you seek

You think excitement has receded
Then the mirror distracts
The logic of the trance
Quickly reaches and grasps
Handsome and faceless
And weightless, your imagination runs

And now it's no ones fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

In the moonlight they're more thrilling
Those things that he knows
As he leads you through the grinning
Bubble blowers in the snow
Watching his exit
Was like falling off the ferry in the night

The inevitables gather to push you around
Any other voice makes such a punishing sound
He became laughter's assassin
Shortly after he showed you what it was

And now it's no ones fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

If you've a lesson to teach me,
I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me,
I'm sinking in, until you return
If you've a lesson to teach me,
Don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate,
Let's get it ingrained

If you've a lesson to teach me,
I'm listening, ready to learn

127,The Lovers ,"Up from the pastures of boredom
out from the sea of discontent
they come in packs like hungry hounds
the seekers of the dark enchantment.

They haunt the boulevards and bars
they pray to wishing wells and stars
they ride the hurricane of hope
not looking back but on they go
toward the distance and deceiving
and all the while they keep believing
that they are special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.

And when they pair off two by two
they feel they are the chosen few
and though their beds are made of straw
they feel like velvet in the night
and so the night is never ending
it's made of distance and pretending
because they're special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.

And when love goes away
and when goes...
goodbye...
catches in their throats like cotton
arises in their hearts like rain
the good times suddenly are all forgotten
the hunt begins again.

They search the subways and the streets
their faces tired, like their feet
their bodies aching to be warm
and so they hide behind the moon
their loneliness inside them growing
but they take comfort in just knowing
that they are special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.

And when love comes again
and when love comes
hello...
arises from their throats like singing
catches in their hearts like wind
the good things
strangers in their arms are bringing
makes life all right again.

They turn their faces to the light
no longer hiding in the night
so unashamed and unafraid
that they can face each other's faults
and though the waltz will have its ending
there is no harm in just pretending
that they are special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers."
128,The Nettles ,"Sank into their calculations and snorted on a stench
a bare arithmetic
look for the boy who was hanging his head low
more trophies and ideas
to follow their pretend.

with a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face
he followed with obedience and fell in the nettles.

I flew in some spiked meniscus and he bought his own rope
and skipped against the rode
did start not to find the dark lead and catch that man i hope
devices man are closed
he lost all his foot holes.

and with a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face
he followed with obedience and fell in the nettles,fell in the nettles, fell in the nettles

he was a toothpick and the garlic and the cinder upon the pub
failed to blunt or hinder, a slow collapse
and clinging to the door frame he was trapped
after a reminder of where he had been

with a smile in his pocket and a scowl on his face
there was nowhere to flee
just had to tent in the nettles"
129,The Ultracheese ,"Still got pictures of friends on the wall
I suppose we aren't really friends anymore
Maybe I shouldn't ever have called that thing friendly at all
Get freaked out from a knock at the door
When I haven't been expecting one
Didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?

We'll be there at the back of the bar
In a booth like we usually were
Every time there was a rocket launch or some big event
What a death I died writing that song
From start to finish, with you looking on

It stays between us, Steinway, and his sons
Because it's the ultracheese

Perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
Dressed like a fictional character
From a place they called America in the golden age
Trust the politics to come along
When you were just trying to orbit the sun
When you were just about to be kind to someone
Because you had the chance

I've still got pictures of friends on the wall
I might look as if I'm deep in thought
But the truth is I'm probably not
If I ever was

Oh, the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne
I've done some things that I shouldn't have done
But I haven't stopped loving you once"

Nothing like it first thing in the morning
You push the button and we’ll do the rest
Bastard latin
That’s the best thing for it
You push the button and we’ll do the rest

You and Lizzy in the summertime
Wrapping my tiny mind around a lullaby

There are things that I just cannot explain to you
And those that I hope I don’t ever have to 

Pattern language, in the mood for love
You push the button and we’ll do the rest

You and Genie wearing stetson hats
Trying to gain access to my lily pad

There are things that I just cannot explain to you
And those that I hope I don’t ever have to

The world’s first ever monster truck front flip
I’m just a bad girl trying to be good
I’ve got a laser guiding my love that I cannot adjust

More brain shrinking moving images

132,There'd Better Be A Mirrorball ,"[Verse 1]
Don't get emotional, that ain't like you
Yesterday's still leaking through the roof
That's nothing new
I know I promised this is what I wouldn't do
Somehow giving it the old romantic fool
Seems to better suit the mood

[Chorus]
So if you wanna walk me to the car
You oughta know I'll have a heavy heart
So can we please be absolutely sure
That there's a mirrorball?

[Verse 2]
You're getting cynical and that won't do
I'd throw the rose tint back on the exploded view
Darling, if I were you
And how's that insatiable appetite?
For the moment whеn you look them in the eyеs
And say, ""Baby, it's been nice""

[Chorus]
So do you wanna walk me to the car?
I'm sure to have a heavy heart
So can we please be absolutely sure
That there's a mirrorball for me?
Oh, there'd better be a mirrorball for me"
133,This House Is A Circus ,"This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though
Look, what it's done to your friends
Their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want 
is for the feeling to end

This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though
Look, what it's done to your friends
Their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want 
is for the feeling to end

There’s a room full of trouble and there's lovers to be had
Those walls make sinners out of such lovely lads
Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
In any anomaly you slip into familiar ways

And we’re forever unfulfilled
And can’t think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man’s eyes

Forever unfulfilled
And can’t think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man’s eyes

The more you open your mouth
the more you're forcing performance
And all the attention is leading me to feel important
(Give me obnoxious, give me obnoxious now)
Now that we're here, we may as well go too far

Wriggling around an incident you won't forget
There's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
Aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue
Struggling with the notion that it's life not film

This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though
Look, what it's done to your friends
Their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want 
is for the feeling to end"
134,Too Much To Ask ,"The smiles as she walked in the room
Have all turned into frowns 
Am I too quick to assume 
That the love is no longer in bloom? 
The tantrums and the tears 
Play a very different tune to what they did before 

Her head's red raw And the ending doesn't sound like 
The happiest around 
When you sobbed before it felt much more 
Like the product of a squabble 
Now there's reason for it to be something more 

And no would be, oh, it's uncertain 
Whether the curtain has shut for good 
She says, ""See if it's still raining 
I'm not dressed for it,"" 
And ""if you loved me-"" 
And I interrupt to receive the scowl and stare
But still decided to stop her there 

Would it be outrageous to say 
We're either shouting or we're shagging 
Docked in tempestuous bays 
At least that's how it felt yesterday 
The eyes are getting heavier 
And whether you're asleep or awake 

Is a mystery 
Would a kiss be too much to ask? 
When you fit me as Sunday's frozen pitch 
Fits the thermos flask 
It's a pity, it just hit me, we can't go back 
To the chest touching on the back﻿"

Kiss me underneath the moon's side boob

138,What If You Were Right First Time? ,"Betwixt and between,
The fantastic dream,
And the fear.
Do you wonder where she is
This afternoon?

And does it get on your nerves,
Make you slightly perturbed,
That there's things that you don't know about her?
And even the places that she's never been with yer, seem awful empty without her.

You can't look into those eyes,
Down no telephone line,
What if you were right first time?

Betwixt and between,
The fantastic dream,
And the fear,
You wonder where she is,
This afternoon.

And with the needle in groove
Is there all to prove
And they tell me 'Are your feet still tapping?'
I know there's a first for a trip over the water.
What is the worst that could happen?

You can't look into those eyes,
Down no telephone line,
What if you were right first time?"
139,When The Sun Goes Down ,"I said, who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong
So that she had to roam the streets

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah
That he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences

And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know

Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
I'm sorry, love, I'll have to turn you down

And oh, he must be up to summat*
What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
You start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be, yeah

Cause they said he changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said he changes when the sun goes down
And they said he changes when the sun goes down around here
Around here

Look, here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mr. Inconspicuous
And he don't even have to say owt
She's in the stance ready to get picked up

Bet she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
It doesn't stop in the winter, no

And they said he changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said he changes when the sun goes down
And they said he changes when the sun goes down

Yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore

Have I done something to trigger
The funny looks and the sniggers?
Are they there at all, or is it just paranoia?

Everybody's got their box
Doing what they're told
You pushed my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns
Don't care if it's marketing suicidal
Won't crack or compromise
Your do-rights or individes
Will never unhinge us

And there's a couple of hundred
Think they're Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled
Yeah, long before ya

Just cos we're having a say-so
Not lining up to be playdoh
Oh, in five years time, will it be
""Who the fuck's Arctic Monkeys?""

'Cause everybody's got their box

Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues...

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
And bring on the backlash!

It's not you it's them that are wrong

Tell him to take out his tongue

Hand me your stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya, I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed, with my ex boy,
He’s in the place, but I cant get joy,
Thinking of you in the final throws, this is when my buzzer goes

Run out to meet you, chips and pita
You say 'when we're married' cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya, I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you're on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet

Then you notice little carpet burn
My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first

I cheated myself like I knew I would
I told ya I was trouble, you know that I'm no good
I cheated myself, like I knew I would
I told ya I was trouble, yeah you know that I'm no good"
145,You Probably Couldn't See For The Lights But You Were L ,"One look sends it coursing
through the veins, oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains 
to form expressions on there stupid faces
They don't want to say hello
Like I want to say hello
Well, the heartbeats at its peak
when you're coming up to speak
And now I'm so tense, never tenser
Could all go a bit Frank Spencer?
I'm talking gibberish
tip of the tongue but I can't deliver it
Properly, oh it's all getting on top of me
And if it weren't this dark you'd see 
how red my face has gone yet

Everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that 
to make you smile
Those that claim that they're not showing off 
are drowning in denial
They're not half as bad as me 
say anything and I'll agree
Cause when it comes to acting up
I'm sure I could write the book

And now that you're more than a part in the play
It's slightly easier to think what to say
You had us all, standing on our heads
Doing our best tricks

Never again, never again, oh
will there be another one 
quite as desirable as you
One look sends it coursing
through the veins, oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains 
to form expressions on there stupid faces"
146,You're So Dark ,"You got your H.P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allan Poe
You got your unkind of ravens
And your murder of crows

Catty eyelashes and your Dracula cape
Been flashing triple A passes at the cemetery gates
Cause you’re so dark, babe
But I want you hard

You’re so dark, baby
You’re so dark
You’re so dark
You’re so dark

And you’re so mysterious
Got that obsession with death
I saw you driving your Prius
And even that was Munster Koach-esque

You watch Italian horror and you listen to the scores
Leather-clad and spiked collar I want you down on all fours
Cause you’re so dark, babe
But I want you hard

You’re so dark, baby

I know you’re nothing like mine
Cos she’s walking on sunshine
And your love would tear us apart
And I know I’m not your type
Cos I don’t shun the daylight
But baby I’m willing to start

You’re so dark

Got your H.P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allan Poe
Got your unkind of ravens
Got your murder of crows

You’re so dark, babe

But I want you hard

You’re so dark, baby

But I want you hard

You’re so dark, oh

But I want you hard

You’re so dark, baby"
